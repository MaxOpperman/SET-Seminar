4,1,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uxecmu/do_devops_suffer_less_ageism_as_compared_to/,Do DevOps suffer less ageism as compared to software developers?,i9y815t,"I think the real straight-up ageism stuff mostly happens to people 60+. I'm in my late 40s and I really haven't experienced it so much. Getting my first gig was hard but it's hard for a lot of people and I was able to use my prior work experience to leverage my way into things to some degree.

I've got to be honest, I don't want to sound like I'm dismissing this altogether but most ""ageism"" I see - and I have seen older developers have issues staying in jobs - has less to do with ""Company X won't hire me because I'm 50"" and more to do with ""I've been doing this for 25+ years and somehow, somewhere along the lines I stopped learning new things"". I see a *lot* of older DBAs locked into DBA work because they only really know SQL/Oracle/et al and never even got on board the C#/Java train, much less Python or the new hotness with JS (by which I mean stuff like node and React). There are still a lot of places that still need people who can work their way around RDBs (I mean, hell, I'm not even slightly a DBA and I'm the point man for SQL on my team because I'm willing to do it) so there are still jobs but any time you cordon yourself off from being able to do certain kinds of work, you're lowering the number of companies that can hire you whether you're 25 or 65.

The other thing I think I see - and this is one place where I guess I get that special insight since I've ""only"" been in dev for around a decade at my age - is that industry standards shift around and people aren't always willing to pursue the new thing. For example, back to the database thing it used to be the most important thing in the business to conserve data use, like virtually any time you were repeating data you wanted to create a mapping table or what have you to not have to do that. Now data storage is kind of cheap and there are lots of noSQL type DBs that encourage you to do this. Even with my scant 10ish years of experience I get all kinds of internal red flags about this - what if the duplicated data needs to be updated? What if stuff is off from one record to the next? But the thing is, that ship has sailed and if you waste too much time demanding that we stick with the old ways because the old ways are better (and again, sometimes in many ways they *are* better), you won't learn how to work with the new ways, and when the next shift comes, it's more than likely not going to be ""let's just scrap all this and go back 20 years"", it's going to be ""let's do this new thing based on that thing you didn't want to do"".

Is it possible you're just not keeping your skills up to date? Devops can be significantly more aggressive about keeping skills updated, since you don't really have much control over the stack you're using and the field itself is still relatively young, resulting in a lot of shifting standards. I don't know that I'd call the required skills considerably lower in most cases. 

Well, not for good devops. A lot of companies are still trying to figure out what that looks like, though, so there's a certain amount of ""easy to get, easy to hold"" work in the devops field at the moment. I wouldn't expect that to last as the industry defines what is and isn't good practice a bit more.

Where? And what are their sources? Because I'm not seeing it. I'm 35 myself and if anything the demand for my skills is growing because there's just relatively few people who have the experience I have. I graduated in 2002 so I've been working full time professionally for 13 years (and 2 years or so part time before that). And not just that; I've been working as a consultant for the last 10 years or so so I've seen a lot of different problems that I had to solve.

How do you think that compares to a junior just out of school? 

Some companies try to hire as many juniors as possible because they're a lot cheaper. They see code as something you produce by the hour and don't really understand development. And then there's companies that learned, some way, that this isn't the way it works. That you need experienced devs to build complex software just as much as you need an experienced doctor to do a heart transplant.

But how relevant is a docter who only knows bloodletting as a technique?

I haven't seen any ageism at all.

Due to employment nondiscrimination laws, they can't just ask ""hey, are you pregnant or planning to be soon, or do you have a baby or toddler?"", but believe me, some employers will do everything short of that to clearly try and find out.

There's a perspective you get as you get farther along in your career, and it's that you don't really know the things you *thought* you new before.

Essentially, overconfidence in what you know is a telltale sign of someone early in their computer science career.  As you progress in your career, you become much more aware of what you know and don't know, and the things that you previously categorized in the ""I'm an expert!"" category were clearly overstated.

Experience brings a more cautious approach; instead of jumping into a project after seeing 2 examples working, thinking you are now a master of this new framework / language / area of expertise, experience tells us there's a lot more behind the scenes to understand before boldly proceeding because we've been burned too many times before.

While younger programmers interpret this as an inability to learn / lack of ingenuity / whatever, our perspective is one of distrusting what we know until we get some real experience on it, because we've learned that the devil is in the details.

That's my perspective.  I used to call myself ""the cowboy"", I'd pick up a manual for a new language in the afternoon, stay up all night coding, and think I'd have a masterpiece by the following morning.  Now, I see the folly in that.  The end product was unpolished and unreliable much of the time due to lack or true understanding of what was going on behind the scenes.

Today, I take a much more cautious approach because my priorities have changed.

Liberals' collective aggressive assault on our morals, our cultural values, and our traditions have succeeded far worse than apparently thought, if people even in Sweden no longer consider 18+ to be a man, but still a boy.

What I mean by this is, the communist colleges and universities in America have over the past few decades, succeeded in convincing society that 18-22 year olds are not ""adults"" but are in fact ""children"" who need to be babysat and have their hands held, and be stripped of their civil liberties and given over to a nanny state ""for their own good."" It is this infectious communism and pussification culture that has resulted in people no longer taking 18-22 year olds seriously, and treating them like overgrown children.

This is one of the many reasons why it's very hard for 22 year-old college graduates in America to be taken seriously when they try to get into entry-level jobs.

After all, being an amazing engineer clearly means you would be a great manager, right? And managers add SOO much more value than good engineers, so you should totally have to move in that direction!

It leaves developers either having to accept career stagnation, stop doing what they love/are good at, or move into consulting of some sort.

Luckily, more and more companies are recognizing this, and providing true engineering career paths. I think both IBM and Microsoft (among others) allow you to achieve upper management level equivalency as engineers.

I especially like how Microsoft actually has entry level management roles. 

Lower/mid-level management should not be considered a ""higher rank"". It's just another job that has to get done. It has its own skill set, and isn't necessarily harder, or easier, than any other job. If anything, lower/mid level management has a lot LESS impact on the company than engineers do.

2. Limit your resume to 1 pages, 2 pages max!

If the job is for React web development, tell me about other jobs where you were doing React development, not some C++ job from 10 years ago. Sure it's good experience, but if hiring a React developer and I get 5 other resumes that say React right up front, I'll probably self your resume. 

3. Your resume should be custom tailored to every job you apply to. Pick out the keywords from the job posting and go through your master resume (which has all of your experience) and trim down to only show relevant experience and relevant technologies.

I’m going to give more anecdotal evidence here, but from a different (not necessarily unique) perspective. 

I work at a major company (Think Verizon, but with more blue) and am a “team lead.” Within my organization, that puts directly me over senior, standard and junior developers while being in charge of architectural, solution, and personnel decisions. That said, I’m only 25 and I make a pretty decent chunk of money; 150k in a medium CoL area.

With that preface out of the way, I want to echo what a lot of folks in here have said: it’s not your age, it’s your experience. Recruiters just assume you won’t work for cheap, and if you do it will just be to hold you over to your next “real” job. Most recruiting companies don’t really care to talk to me once they learn how much money I make. It’s not because that suddenly makes me older, but because I’m expensive. 

It’s a fair assumption that someone with 10+ years on their resume is quite expensive. Recruiters are looking to find as many candidates in as short a time period as possible. Theyre head hunters. Why would they take you, a candidate that will possibly leave in a few months for a leadership position, when they can get some guy that has been a happy code monkey for awhile. They only get commission if you stay put for a set period.

Likewise, think about a company; why would they *want* you? Not trying to be mean, but you’ve been in the industry for awhile, you should be rather high in the management chain. Why aren’t you? And if you fix your resume to say you were but now you don’t want to be, why not? Are you not capable of leading? If I need you to step up, are you going to bow out? I’m not going to hire you, if that’s the case.

The reason I put my history on here is because of my anecdotal experience. People see my resume and assume I’ve trimmed it down to be short. Then they see a 25 year old on skype or in person and immediately turn me down. And I don’t think it’s because I’m 25, but they know I don’t have the experience they’re looking for. I’m not some grizzled vet, and while I may be worth it, they’re not willing to take that chance.

Your situation is the same, but reverse. You’re not some bright-eyed developer, you’re a grizzled veteran whose been in the game for awhile. You might be worth it, but a lot of folks aren’t willing to take that chance.

Your best bet is definitely consultant at this point, if you’re not interested in management. Also, if you find yourself in management again, don’t be a discriminatory dick.

This is definitely part of it. Of course, it's a flawed piece of reasoning, but I can guarantee this is what's going through the heads of hiring managers and potential interviewers screening the resume.

The reality is CTO and VP positions are rare. There's obviously only a single CTO per company. Small companies may not have any VPs at all; if they do, it'll just be one or two. Larger companies may have lots of VPs, but being a CTO/VP at a small company doesn't necessarily translate to being a VP at a huge corporation (in fact, it flatly does not translate).

But when you're looking at a resume, you don't necessarily think of the above. You just see someone whose previous job was several levels above your own, and you don't see why they'd be on your team reporting to you. You figure they must have screwed up or been incompetent or something. In reality, they just moved on, they recognized it's a long-shot to get the same level of position somewhere else, so they want to go back to being a coder.

I can't attest to anyone else, but I can explain why I don't personally believe it.  
The biggest issue for me is that I've never seen any proof of ageism.  It's generally some random person coming in here, like OP, with their anecdotal evidence.  And it's normally shit evidence.  OP didn't get a job for 7 months - must be ageism...come on.  
My anecdotal evidence directly contradicts theirs.  I see older people (myself included) in software positions constantly.  This includes my current position where I am the youngest at well over 30.  
Additionally - my entire career has been post 30.  Never felt like I was the victim of ageism.  


How is this logically any different from saying ""It happened to me, therefore it must happen to everyone, everywhere.""?  Anecdotal is anecdotal, regardless which side of the argument it is used.

Which is of course totally not the case.  I stay at jobs for a long time, probably too long.


Why would they want me?  Good question.  I thought about this a while back and realized that I probably wouldn't put my resume at the top of the stack if I were looking for a regular or even senior developer.

Why am I not higher in the food chain?  Choice.  I went to school to learn to code, I've spent most of my career coding, have tried moving higher, and didn't like it.  In fact, I believe it affected my mental well-being.  I wouldn't mind being a manager in another industry, but not in tech.  I did it well, we met or exceeded expectations, but board of director's meetings is not what I went to school for, and not what I want to do.  The problem is, it's very difficult to get that across in a resume or cover letter without sounding negative, bitter, or some other unwanted attitude.  And then there's still the thought, ""will he change his mind and be bored?""

I don't like hiding things from my resume.  I worked hard for that experience, but I figured I had to do what I had to do.  Problem is, as you said, it all falls apart when you have your first in person.  I may not act grizzled or have grizzled person goals, but I sure as fuck look grizzled.

I like your post.  I didn't find that part to be mean at all.  It's reality, and sometimes it hits you at unexpected ages.  I don't blame the industry.  I don't even blame the people who foster this behavior.  They're trying to make as much money as they can to either survive or make shareholders happy.  It's business, and if I'm on the wrong path for my age, time to adjust course.",devthrowaway777,True,t3_9wg3xu,t1_e9l8lts,False,2,,Acknowledges ageism exists and has a negative association with it.

I'm going to guess some pretty well populated area but not a tech hub.  This is a problem, you're at a disadvantage in the whole process.  You can't do an onsite without a round trip ticket and not the same day ""swing by and have coffee"" deal.


Crowded, you'd have to have advance API dev, custom backends and/or industry specific knowledge to stand out.


You must fix this very soon.  I've been doing challenges ""here and there"", I use YouTube and others, just pick one a day or so, but fully understand that one, then move on.  Just knowing 20~30 changes the odds as you can re-use solutions and you'll have a ""plan of attack""


So it's ""some college"" because CS wasn't in HS ""back in the day"".

So, few more questions:

Q1. what would it take to finish college?  How far did you get and can you do this online?

Q2. the companies giving you tests, that's pre 1/200?  Meaning you're getting more than 1 out of 200 that are asking you to take a leetcode type test?  I ask because these are pretty automated and should be given out like candy.  So I'm wondering if doing better on those gets you past 1/200 and more toward 30/200.

Discussion: the degree has maybe two things, GE and CS/MIS/...  If you finished the GE and have some CS, you should be close.  Might be 1 semester or even some online.

The location you should at some point make a decision on this.  A long time friend of mine moved from NorCal to LA to North West and is now at $165K/yr doing the servers for medical claims processing.  He moved a number of times to make things work and I'm not sure he always got compensation for moving.

I don't know the exact languages but here's a problem that might be there.  If you're into Web Dev, you could be competing against everyone HS~college kid that's just starting out.  I say this because a lot of web dev starts in HS.  What they don't usually have is full server/ custom API dev mixed with paid professional experience.  Even if some of that experience is old.  Example: I was the SQL DBA/ server manager for a very large company.  Even thou that was a while back, it still looks good and can edge you in.

I know there's a lot of need for SaaS right now and mobile platform's custom back ends.  I just got certified full stack for custom dev about a year ago, it's different from Firebase/Realm/...

So it looks like a number of things to work on, location is a tough one, but I would focus on the others first.  If I'm correct in the assumption that leetcode tests are pre 1/200 then that's a BIG factor and you need to hammer that loose nail right quick.  Adding new skills that are less common and are directly asked for can be a mixed bag, professionals can add skills pretty quick, but some head hunters just look for skills listed.

I'm going to say that you don't have an age issue at this point.  You don't have a degree, your skills might be a bit too common and you don't seem to live in the right area.  The leetcode tests are a given, you have no choice, try to make a fun game/challenge out of them and maybe enjoy them.

What do you think?",e9ley0h,"No problem! The online form submissions are notoriously bad because HR departments typically have software which scans through your resume to find keywords...and usually the HR person is setting the keywords...so I might tell HR to find someone with an  Angular background and HR types AngularJs as one of the keywords, which if you are an Angular dev you know AngularJs means version 1.x which is basically a different framework than Angular (which means version 2+ and I believe version 7 just came out). So there is a big difference between Angular and AngularJs. Job description might say Angular so you make sure you have Angular listed on your resume but HR messes up and types AngularJs as one of the filter terms so now your resume is never found because you never listed AngularJs in your resume. Then even if you come up as a match in their system, the HR person isn't really qualified to know if you have the right skillset or not so you might get weeded out just because they don't know what they are looking for exactly beyond keyword matching (they aren't technical). And depending on the company, they may or may not have their email form configured correctly on their site so your emails end up in someone's inbox who is on vacation or not even working for the company anymore. You can quickly see there is a lot of red tape before your resume ends up in the hands of a dev manager who is actually qualified to determine whether it is worth it to give you a call and start the interview process. It is more akin to a lottery system, because the best candidates don't always get selected.

If you can get on a call with HR, they can at least ask you some questions which most of your answers should be ""yes I have experience with X language/framework"" and then they will say, go ahead and send me your resume and I'll forward it along to the dev manager...because you just qualified yourself to HR and now go past all the obstacles and red tape. 

I use to blindly submit to those form submissions on the company websites but got no calls and barely an email to  say no. But then I started calling the companies and asking to speak to HR because ""I submitted the my resume through the form on the website but the website had an error message so I just wanted to make sure it was received okay""...which this forced the HR person to actually look in their database and find my resume, at which point they could quickly see I had some of the keywords they were looking for....then I would ask then a question or 2 about the job if they didn't start asking me prescreening type questions....then usually the conversation would naturally end with them saying they would turn my resume over to the dev manager. That had a very high successful rate.

A few times I even showed up to the company in person with my resume. That method is hit or miss. Some people get really annoyed by it while others love the enthusiasm and sometimes do an interview on the spot.

TLDR: Anytime you can get on the phone with someone, you can increase your chances of your resume actually making it into the right hands. You can you use the online resume form submissions but it's a complete lottery at that point...but you can increase probability by calling HR in addition to submitting your resume online.",the_brizzler,False,t3_9wg3xu,t1_e9la447,False,2,,Doesn't think ageism exists.

I was thinking.. you know what I should do.. go speak at companies with youngsters.. or even colleges... and stress.. how difficult it is today. When I was starting out.. 20 years ago there was a massive shortage of developers and tons of money and ideas/companies... today.. apparently there is still a massive shortage.. but I find companies are SUPER picky who they hire now. I dont blame them.. but at the same time, there is WAY more competition today for developers than 20 years ago. Oddly..the money has barely gone up. In fact, when I was starting out, I worked with contractors that were making upwards of 300 an hour. They were 3 month to 6 month stints.. but that was insane. Today, if you can find contract for > 100 an hour that is impressive. Yet, costs have gone way up.. dont understand that one. Guess more supply of developers/competition has greatly decreased pay levels since developers are ""a dime a dozen"" today. Still pays well enough though in most areas, just not much more than I was making 20 years ago. 
But.. I was thinking.. though I dont like the idea of ""big brother"" in our Govt (US specifically but probably world wide), it would be almost good for an enforcement of a 401K plan like taxes that comes out of your check no matter what. With the supposed social security (in US) going away in 20 years or less, it seems to me one of the most important things anyone in the workforce today but especially those starting out could or absolutely musst learn is saving for the future. Its too bad we dont have an automatic/guarantee as you get a year older you work 5 minutes less per day and get 1 extra vacation day per year. By the time you have put 30 years in, you have 40+ days vacay, and working 5 hour days... to match the fact that most of us as we get older learn less/slower, work slower, need more healthcare/sleep/etc... and should be able to retire with a decent living.. assuming you didnt do stupid stuff to get in to debt.
But I am blown away in my kids schools they learn nothing about money, the real world, jobs, etc. I dont know why we havent mandated as part of school they must do a job at school, balance money, pay bills, etc.. because it is only getting harder today than ever, with automation (no thanks to those of us that write code that eventually replaces jobs), less jobs, more competition, etc. Maybe I should write a book!

My degree is MIS, it comes from the schools of business, it has probably the most programming without being CS, and is mainly on project management and systems analysis.

I think there were some 10~12 classes, past GE stuff.  It's been a good while.

The upside is that you should already know this stuff.  It's like saying you need to take a driver's ed class.  You've been driving for many years, why would a driver's ed class be very hard?

Here's the deal, you are asking some company to invest in you because you are at the level of a professional programmer.  You don't have the degree, which most professional programmers have.  So you're asking them to go out on a limb for you because you're claim is you have the skills/knowledge...

If you actually do have the skills/knowledge, the classes directly related to programming should be a walk in the park.  In addition, the leetcode tests shouldn't be that hard.  I know for me I just switch languages and they didn't do test in Swift at the time.  It sucked because I was now new at a new language that wasn't used by Amazon and some others.

So I had to pickup yet another language.

One point is that if hired, one side is claiming they can do the work, the other side has to trust that they can, yet one side doesn't have the common level of proof (the degree) and is competing against people that can have the degree and years of experience in an area that's been flooded since the DotCom crash.

When DotCom hit, everyone was a web dev.  HS kids with a laptop were web devs.  Everyone was learning Java.

You're in the greatest economy you've ever seen in your life and you're trying to get into one of the hottest jobs the world knows and you're not sure if you want to take classes for stuff you should know like the back of your hand.

If I were to ask you how to merge onto the freeway, would it really be that hard?  You've merged onto the freeway a million times.

How many web pages have you developed?  How many servers have you setup?  If you have that level of experience, you should be able to do that in your sleep.


Based on this, they are passing you up because of location and education.  This is without seen the resume and if there's any big names on there as well as how well it's written.

Just for a frame of reference, there's been a few posts on here where devs with 3~5 years are getting calls non-stop.

One last note, back in the day, I heard of people challenging classes for credit.  I know that Stanford and other offer online credit.  I've taken Yale, Harvard, MIT and Stanford classes several times, I just don't pay for the credit.

You take the class online and the in class test should be a walk in the park.

I originally went to university for CS but dropped out and never got a degree. Stumbled into testing and grew to team lead and manager through that. Spent a lot of that part of my career trying to get in earlier in the SDLC, and managed to get a lot of the devs around me to realize if they involved me in design I could break their design before they started coding when it's so much faster and cheaper to fix. I spent time being a test manager without a team (coordinating/influencing other teams) and eventually evolved to technical project manager without really noticing. 

Last role I had was back as testing manager before someone I'd worked with a decade ago reached out to me about becoming a dev manager - something I hadn't really considered until then. 

So maybe I'm not the example you're looking for because I haven't become an individual contributor developer who spends their day coding - I'm involved only so far down as the design level but I would not be effective at implementation. While most people in testing invested their time learning automation, I spent more of my time on people and project than coding. I did also completely jump industries at the same time too. From mobile firmware, radio and security right into web dev. Huge transition moving into dev and into a different industry at the same time, but the company I'm at doesn't pay top dollar so they're more willing to take a chance on someone like me. I love the team, the company, the work and at this point in my life that's more important. 

I also didn't set out to become a tester, a TPM, or dev manager - but both testing and project management are on on the decline so it was the right move for me. 

The only advice I would have given my younger self was to have actually spent more time hands on learning automation. I would have thought myself more capable to transition earlier - I was miserable at my last job far too long. 

If you know how to code, I don't think school is going to be essential, but finding that first dev job is hard either way. Are there any opportunities at your current company, even on a trial basis?

The biggest ageism I see is the use of leetcode type questions for interviews.  This is stuff I mostly haven't touched in 20 years.  When I graduated, I was the king of these - now I have forgotten most it.  Unfortunately, this is a big factor.  I think this is a nice, easy way to discriminate against those with young families (who can't spend the time re-learning this), or people who have been out of the college for a while.  The Department of Labor would have no idea that reversing a binary tree in 20 minutes on coderpad has little correlation with deploying and running a system on AWS, so they can get away with it.  

But that's the only one I experienced.  There could be some that I cannot perceive.  For example, I'm less than 10 miles away from Apple.  I had applied to about 5-10 positions that I am more or less perfect for, including a weird mix of old and new technologies that hardly anybody would have.  But no response from them.  This is probably because they have tons of candidates, but you can't help but wonder if it is age discrimination.  I will never know.

Other than that, I found that interviewers are fine.  But everyone's unique.  My skillset is very current, so I didn't have that issue.  Sure, there are those that struggle, but many of them have not kept their skill set up to date.  I mean, someone can be an expert of SQL, but not knowing NoSQL disqualifies you from a lot of data jobs these days.

In terms of ""long hours"", I actually found many of those in their 40s more willing to do that than many in their 20s.  Those that are married and have kids that are grown a bit are more likely to not bat an eye when there's a 8AM and 10PM meeting with the office in India for example.  

Overall though, the stereotype that older people are unemployable is kind of false.  Companies good workers.

Here is the deal after what you will see a decade into work: you will either want to be a technically proficient person or you want to be in leadership. Hopefully you are at a firm that 1. actually distinguishes between the two and 2. are ok with the course of action you want to take realizing you can do both but won't be as good as you can be when you have to multi task. 

&#x200B;

Then comes a whole new set of challenges for either.

&#x200B;

 For the technical proficiency it is learning by doing, documenting and sharing as well as refactoring what you have done. It is gaining more technical acumen to be put onto hard projects everyone wants. The solution is to do projects no one wants and to continue to get solutions. 

For the leadership track, this can be a whole other world. Budgets, balance sheets, culture, teams, leading leaders versus managing resources.  Be the first and be a leader. Sometimes being a leader means you have to make hard calls and stand by decisions. If I was not willing to get fired for doing the right thing, then I am of no use to lead. 

&#x200B;

BTW, I'm 2+ decades in.  I lead leaders so my technical day to day coding has gone down a lot. I still work on side projects  and explore new technology but it is not my day to day. My job is to act as lead blocker for my department, work with program management on what is up for the next quarter and to tactically devise roadmap for the next couple of quarters out. 

&#x200B;

This isn't really ageism, kids don't come out of school as Leetcode gods either. Everyone has to grind that stuff.

How do I know it was ageism? From the faces of the people at the in-person interview after the successful phone interview. *Eyes glaze over.* Disappointment. A short, unfriendly interview and no job offer.

I removed everything from my resume that indicated my age, like my graduation years. I removed a couple decades of experience; it was old tech that wasn't helpful anyway, just identified me as an old guy. That helped get me interviews.

I was blond until about age 40; by 50 my hair was white. I dyed my hair blond, which blended well with the white and looked pretty natural but helped me look younger.

When I learned I was going to be a Dad again at age 54, PowerBuilder was in decline and I knew it wasn't going to pay for the baby's college, so I turned to C# / .Net. I never mastered it. It was such a complicated development environment: so many targets, so many technologies, *shifting* technologies that are hot one year and cold a couple years later. I was OK with C# itself was never that fluent with the frameworks.

This is my personal values and our standard

New hire or existing employee:

RELEVANT and DIVERSE technical experience for the role will give a leg up to be interviewed or keep you there/help you be promoted

,but the technical experience and even more importantly the BEHAVIORAL skills have to pass and maintain a higher bar for more experienced people

AGE IS NOT A FACTOR

Individual contributors with a lot of experience regularly make more than the managers managing them. There are more spots to be a highly experienced and well-paid engineer than a manager.

Now, here are some reasons why a very experienced engineer may find it hard to get in or stay in a tech company:

- Not staying up-to-date with very fast changing & business-relevant technology and high-value/impact projects/teams

- Stuck in their ways BEHAVIORALLY and assuming they can just do what they want because of their technical experience

- Not understanding that with more experience and more pay, there are even HIGHER expectations to  stay at the peak of the individual contributor engineer track

- Not understanding that you have to have influence and impact relevant to your role WITHOUT being a manager/the people authority

Management/people leadership track has different expectations and not as much change. There is also A LOT of support from company systems. 

The reality is naturally as humans, we age and with age our lower energy and mental capacities leads to the above reasons. 

Therefore statistically people with higher age tend to naturally be impacted for those reasons.

In nearly every case I've seen where people have remained unemployed and blamed ageism, the real problem has been outdated skillsets. Sometimes severely outdated skillsets. 

I literally just had a conversation with a guy last month who was complaining about not being able to find a job after more than 25 years of programming. He blamed ageism. When I asked him about the quality of his public repos, I learned that he had no idea how to use Github and that the ONLY source management application he'd ever used was Microsoft Visual Sourcesafe (his employer apparently tried to move to SVN after SS was retired, but they gave up on it and moved to a network share system...yikes). He'd spent the last 15 years creating .Net Web Forms apps for his previous employer and had no idea how modern application development worked. As in, no Agile, never written a test, never worked in any sort of cloud environment, etc. His skillset was straight out of 2005. 

I've had this same conversation more times than I can count with other developers my age. It's easy to blame ageism, but the reality of the industry is that it's a never-ending rabbit chase. If you stop learning the latest technologies and techniques and stop trying to keep up with the industry, you stop being relevant.

FWIW, the guy is now getting ready to start a 24-week programming bootcamp to update his skills and learn how things are done in the modern era.

One thing I noticed is when you see a big tech company that is seemingly loaded with youth, maybe it's their hiring practices, or maybe it's just that older workers are not attracted to that company due to long hours culture and other demands they are not willing in their careers to do. 

I'm a 47 year old UX designer, and I'll tell you when I'm looking at potential places to work, I'm being a bit more selective. I'm looking for places that are not big companies where everyone is a number, and there isn't a long hours culture. 

Right now I'm working for a B2B software company and I'm happy. It doesn't have the pizzazz of a Facebook, Google, or Apple, but I get done with work at 5:00 on most days, and can live my life. Even one of my managers stated he believes in good mental health, and thus pushes away any thoughts of long hours culture. 

There are companies out there that are going to cling to this idea that only youth can do this work, but then there are others who simply either want someone with a better work ethic and more longevity, or these companies simply don't have the luxury to be that selective. 

Also, I found in this line of work that as you get older, many companies expect you to get more into a thinking and decision making role and not so much of a ""worker bee"" or ""doer"" role. A lot of companies will see someone with 20+ years of experience and would rather they be making decisions, leading, and mentoring as opposed to just plopping into a chair and writing code. 

Be aware of that. If you have decades of experience, you might want to make sure you consider managerial roles. Somebody who avoids them oftentimes doesn't look good to a company. If you are older and do not have a lot of experience, just step away from the companies that all the youth are chasing, and you'll find many places more open and willing and even liking the idea of an older worker.

Absolutely. It's not unique to engineering, but it 100% exists in tech, and there are numerous industries where you're likely to see a distrust of people of certain ages.

The experience argument doesn't really hold weight, because many industries aren't capable of hiring people with 10+ years experience due to cost. There's a reason why the cool startup with the ping pong table or the agency with ""fly by the seat of your pants"" painted in a mural in their breakout room is mostly people under 30, and that's because they are limited to hiring people that lack experience. Sure, you could say ""oh boo-hoo it's their fault"", but the industry isn't perfect, and if you wanted to work in a startup you might find that you're either severely undervaluing yourself, or working in a place that's a poor cultural fit.

Again, you might say that it doesn't matter because ""Software Engineers are well-paid"", and the answer to that is ""lol no"". The world doesn't begin and end with America, and you might find that well-paid is a misnomer, because they could live in a HCOL city in their own country and be nowhere near affording a house, saving for retirement, etc. It's painful that this needs to be said, but /r/cscareerquestions and Blind is in no way representative of the real world. Guess what? Some experienced people in the UK and Europe might only get paid around £35-40k a year. In places with a lower cost-of-living it might be substantially less.

With that being said, this isn't unique to Software Engineering. To illustrate how common this is, there is literally an episode of Friends about this and the advertising industry. Ageism exists everywhere, and you'll likely find that it's treated the same in our field as it is in others - people will gravitate towards certain industries with a good cultural fit, and those places will likely match what they expect from a job.

* Putting their bonus into a set of private pensions and investment accounts that allow for tax-free investment
* Set up a LISA, fill it every year and take the £1k that the government give you for your first home or retirement

We're comparing *average* SWEs with *experienced* (successful) professionals. It seems the definition of 'experienced' for an engineer is an average engineer with years of service, but the 'experienced' professional is a highly competent one who has experienced steep TC progression - the other professions' FAANG equivalent like Sidley or Skadden Arps or McKinsey engagement managers.

For the purposes of this comparison, I'm going to ignore workload (engineers have the least, even at Amazon) and include education where appropriate. 

* The average investment banker never progresses beyond analyst. Those that make vice president are pulling in $250k+$250k ($500k TC) or more. That's about FB E5. Directors and such make more, but anyone who gets into BB IBD in the first place is already FAANG equivalent, because IBD is incredibly competitive and places a high emphasis on school pedigree. 

* The average experienced lawyer doesn't work at biglaw or as internal counsel and makes $100k in private or small law office. Those who work at biglaw don't often make partner. Biglaw is more competitive than FAANG. The lawyers who make more than an experienced SWE have many more years of experience and 4 more years of schooling. Biglaw likewise weights heavily on law school prestige. The similarly experienced engineer is ahead of the biglaw associate.

* The average experienced physician doesn't begin work until his late 20s or early 30s depending on residency and specialty. The path to practice is more fraught, many medical school graduates taking several years to match a residency. However, once practicing, the entry-level physician immediately has a TC higher than the average experienced engineer, and far more as an anaesthesiologist or surgeon. The physician's TC growth is relatively small unless he becomes a medical director. However, doctors can make their money in many places beyond SF, Seattle, and NY. If you're ambitious and capable enough to be a doctor, you can get into FAANG. Nevertheless, the physician has the edge.

* The average MBB consultant must have gone to a tier 1 school, like biglaw or IB. He starts out making $120k. Most never make it to EM, but if he's good and stick around for 5 years he probably will. Now his TC is $250k with constant travel and no clear path upward. However, his exit opportunities are great. Neither SWE nor MBB have the edge here.

Anyone ambitious and intelligent enough to be a successful lawyer or physician could become an engineer, but not nearly every experienced engineer could become a successful lawyer or physician. MBB and IB are much more soft-skills focused, about networking and selling, and weight very heavily on school pedigree.

You’re the one who brought up the claim that only elite jobs can compete with a decidedly standard (albeit a bit above average) professional income range of $100-150k. 

Really not sure where you’re going with the banking example. Most of the attrition at the analyst level is driven by more lucrative buyside jobs to the tune of 60%+ of most analyst classes at firms employing the majority of entry level bankers. These buyside jobs pay at the low end $175-200k and on the high end $250-400k 2 years out of school. Analysts who are performing averagely are free to stay on to ASO and beyond but not many tend to want to. Plenty of folks also peruse cushy, well-paid Corp Dev or Finance dept jobs if they want better WLB and typically enjoy faster promos than those without IB exp (aka more $$s sooner). Irregardless of all of that, the IB track still pays vastly more than an average SWE career - since, as you’ve rightly noted, the field is inherently elite to begin with.

The point is, average SWE careers aren’t special or inherently lucrative. Plenty of average professionals who have settled into their careers make the same as an average SWE who has settled into theirs. It’s not out of the ordinary at all for an average tenured accountant (PP or in-house), lawyer (PP or in-house), architect, ad agency pro, consultant (i.e. excl MBB/T2), engineer, HR dept professional, ops & supply chain dept professional, finance dept professional, B2B salesperson, commercial banker, wealth manager, R&D scientist, retail buyer, retail merchandiser, aircraft pilot, marketing dept professional, industrial designer, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, construction project manager, construction cost manager, real estate professional, commercial insurance broker, investment bank / investment firm middle office / back office dept professional and so on.. to make $100-150k a year as a professional well into their career. It is not at all a surprising figure. 

EDIT: you edited your post… will review and see if I need to add anything

1. FB E5 does not make the same as an IB VP on avg, FB E5 is roughly $300-450k vs $450-650k IB VP.

2. Nobody said anything about BigLaw or in-house jobs at major corporations or elite startups. Those both are inherently elite jobs that pay more than average SWE. Not sure why they’re mentioned. Aside from that, plenty of lawyers in regional commercial law firms serving middle market clients or even in smaller general practice outfits or in-house at middle market companies or even in government that make $100-150k or more. 

3. Being a physician is an inherently elite job that pays more than average SWE - yes, add’l schooling and debt but the security and scale of their income means they catch up pretty quickly. Not sure why this is mentioned.

4. MBB/T2 consulting is also an inherently elite career (inclusive of exit opps) that pays more than average SWE not sure why this is being put forward.

This conversation is about average SWE jobs not being particularly special vis-a-vis other average professional jobs.

Best advice I can give is have a few things you can do at a intermediate level and build a portfolio you can show people. Being a dev is kinda like being an artist at an ad firm. The best way to convince someone you know your stuff is to show them what you can do.

How do you build a portfolio? Start a passion project and put it on github, contribute to other public projects, make a YouTube channel with instructional videos, set up a webserver with a site that's more than just a personal WordPress blog (although there are devs who can't even do that...).

They act as a filler and when there is a ramp down the young guns are technically better and the more senior ones are better managers whereas the 15 year experience guy is neither here nor there.
2. I have seen freshers eager to learn and be hands on whereas the acting manager expects entire team to learn and work and is happy with just overlooking the project. No hands on 
3. I have seen very few effort . Most of them are happy with their complacent lifestyle. Do not keep with current trends and are usually stuck in thoughts that are 10 years primitive.
4. Would struggle with freelancing due to above points.

I am not generalizing entire 15+ experience folks but most of the Indian software engineers I worked with in 3MNC across 5 cities and 2 countries have the exact problem I pointed out .

I haven't suffered ageism yet. I guess my looks are also favouring me here, I tend to look younger than I am. In fact, I have suffered the ""you are too young/millennial to be here"" on some high-in-the-scale positions.

Some of my peers have had issues when returning to work after having birth. But that's not strictly related to age, more to family conciliation. Here the remote working options helped a bit. But specially on companies that like to crunch, having babies is a handicap to get hired.

About sexism: yes. A lot. Unless you go to an explicit safe space, you will suffer sexism. Don't doubt it. I am a hard geek but have been pushed to management/sales tasks since the beginning of my career because it looks like I have ""good soft skills"". ha! It doesn't matter how strong I said I wanted to remain technical, I kept being pushed over and over again. Most of my geek profile had to be reinforced by volunteering on communities outside work (where sexism also exists). Privilege showing here: I could work on communities using my free time to leverage my profile.

Having to take notes on meetings, having to deal with customers (they are happy with you!), having to do management/administrative tasks (your projects always end on time and budget!),... If I had to start over again I would fake lousy soft skills so no one think of me for those tasks. And then probably I would still be on the lowest position possible because I would be a crazy lady hard to work with.

And regarding the frontend/backend, I tried to focus my career to be a sysadmin/kernel developer/hard backend stuff. And over and over again I was pushed out of that role to more frontend stuff. After fighting a lot I was able to sit on something in between (Full stack developer that finally evolved to Java Backend). And this cost me much more than what my average male peers had to deal with to get the same.

Recently I started working on Red Hat where I can truly focus on the technical side and forget about management/sales and I can't be happier.

I have known a lot of teachers that went on stress leave because there was no support from the principle.  At the same time tech can be stressful with ship deadlines etc...  I don't think the field you choose will define whether your work environment is toxic.  I think the company or school you work at defines whether an environment is toxic.   


No one can tell you to do teaching or tech.  You have to figure that out yourself.  I would NOT volunteer for a startup.  I did the startup thing for 8 years and even getting paid I lost money.  If there was a big payout I realized I would have gotten $100,000.  I forfeited way more than $100,000 over those 8 years in terms of salary.  I should have got a corporate job and been happy working regular hours instead of getting paid less and essentially volunteering for a tone of overtime.

Tech is full of imposter syndrome (feeling like you are no good) and feeling like the grass is always greener somewhere else.  I have not gotten over the imposter syndrome but I left the grass is greener syndrome behind me.  You can't avoid imposter syndrome though no matter how much you learn.  There will always be some tech guy that knows more or is doing something you would rather do.  You have to be happy with the competence you have gained in the field you are in and be happy that they keep paying you.

If you decide to go back to Tech I would not go back to your old job (nor do that startup thing).  If you don't need the money don't go back to your old job.  Look for another job!  Why go back there?  You don't have to.  The market is tight right now.  Employers can't find enough people.  Realize you can provide a benefit to a company with what you do and go out there and get a new job.  It is disheartening but everyone feels like that.  It can take 6 months to get a corporate job with lots of rejection but tons and tons of people find jobs.  You can to.  If you want to try something knew, the best thing is to get into a bigger company using the the tech skills you have.  Once you are in after a couple of years you can shift sideways and gain more skills in either a different role or by taking on additional projects.  Getting a job and shifting laterally in a company is way better than trying to start all over again with new education and then doing a new job search.

That experience provides value in terms of understanding the users/market/learning science. I've worked with many ex-teachers and precisely none of them regretted that move.

Over the course of my career, I have also found myself in toxic work environments and got really good at spotting them during an interview.  I really look to the attitudes of the people who are interviewing me and look for any hint that they might be jerks.  I look closely at the office culture.

Red flags:   
Do you have a bar at your company?  That means this will be very cliquish and they will require a lot of long hours.  It also means that if I have to get home to help with my kids, I will eventually be on the outs with everyone.  

Rank and yank?  Be wary of companies that pit their employees against each other and rank them (firing the bottom 10%).  Collaboration is gone and lots of time you end up in the bottom 10% on a technicality (because you are the most Junior for instance).

How is your office decorated?  The standard bland beige cubicle MAY be ugly, but every company I have ever worked for with these cubes has treated me better than any of these high-tech looking places with cool designs everywhere.  The latter is usually filled with hipsters who don't know anything about management or basic respect and dignity.  

Is it a ""bro-culture?""  If so, run.  These guys do not know how to treat employees and try to run things like a fraternity.

Does the person interviewing you argue with you on a coding solution (tech specific).  I had one who's solution had a freaking bug in it and he argued with me over why his was better.  No thank you.  

Are the managers under 33 or worse in their 20's?  Run.  Most of these guys can't manage and resort to trying to scream at people like they saw Hoosiers once and think that is how you get things done.  The best managers get their employees backs and act as a barrier between them and every asshole with an opinion on their work.

I also hit up glassdoor and look for the underlying themes of the reviews.  If a good amount of them say management is poor, I do not accept a position at that company.

Hardly!

They were paying a ton for it and getting crap and I just happened to be pretty decent in Unity and C#.  They originally hired me for my graphic design and 3D modeling skills.  

So I spent a week showing I could in fact do it and they gave me runway.  Having me do it cost the $7k for a better product than they were paying $180k for.  From there, they asked me to do all sorts of coding projects and gave me lots of runway and support.  I used the opportunity to get way better.  

Udemy was my go-to.  Programming with Mosh made me a better programmer.  I usually was doing his course while simultaneously doing a pro project next to it.  The concepts really hammered home.  I got another course on optimizing programming which was awesome too.  Learned how to do Unity testing, Node, javascript, java (which honestly was a cakewalk since C# is syntactically identical).  2 years in and I was really good.  Spent the next year giving that job every reason to give me a raise to a programmer's salary...got the run around, applied for dev jobs and found one in about 6 months.  My last company freaked out when I gave in my notice.  The director called me in to ask why I was leaving, which was 2 fold.  One, I wanted a job that was keeping up with the latest tech.  Two, proper pay for my level.  They gave me counter that was about 10k too low and I left.  

Got into my new job and was a rock star in a week.  Pulled off adapting their project to an XBox controller in a week.  Used adapter pattern, but had to refactor the general controls a bit to make that possible.
