4,4,1,cscareerquestions,Do DevOps suffer less ageism as compared to software developers?,i9y815t,"I think the real straight-up ageism stuff mostly happens to people 60+. I'm in my late 40s and I really haven't experienced it so much. Getting my first gig was hard but it's hard for a lot of people and I was able to use my prior work experience to leverage my way into things to some degree.

I've got to be honest, I don't want to sound like I'm dismissing this altogether but most ""ageism"" I see - and I have seen older developers have issues staying in jobs - has less to do with ""Company X won't hire me because I'm 50"" and more to do with ""I've been doing this for 25+ years and somehow, somewhere along the lines I stopped learning new things"". I see a *lot* of older DBAs locked into DBA work because they only really know SQL/Oracle/et al and never even got on board the C#/Java train, much less Python or the new hotness with JS (by which I mean stuff like node and React). There are still a lot of places that still need people who can work their way around RDBs (I mean, hell, I'm not even slightly a DBA and I'm the point man for SQL on my team because I'm willing to do it) so there are still jobs but any time you cordon yourself off from being able to do certain kinds of work, you're lowering the number of companies that can hire you whether you're 25 or 65.

The other thing I think I see - and this is one place where I guess I get that special insight since I've ""only"" been in dev for around a decade at my age - is that industry standards shift around and people aren't always willing to pursue the new thing. For example, back to the database thing it used to be the most important thing in the business to conserve data use, like virtually any time you were repeating data you wanted to create a mapping table or what have you to not have to do that. Now data storage is kind of cheap and there are lots of noSQL type DBs that encourage you to do this. Even with my scant 10ish years of experience I get all kinds of internal red flags about this - what if the duplicated data needs to be updated? What if stuff is off from one record to the next? But the thing is, that ship has sailed and if you waste too much time demanding that we stick with the old ways because the old ways are better (and again, sometimes in many ways they *are* better), you won't learn how to work with the new ways, and when the next shift comes, it's more than likely not going to be ""let's just scrap all this and go back 20 years"", it's going to be ""let's do this new thing based on that thing you didn't want to do"".

Is it possible you're just not keeping your skills up to date? Devops can be significantly more aggressive about keeping skills updated, since you don't really have much control over the stack you're using and the field itself is still relatively young, resulting in a lot of shifting standards. I don't know that I'd call the required skills considerably lower in most cases. 

Well, not for good devops. A lot of companies are still trying to figure out what that looks like, though, so there's a certain amount of ""easy to get, easy to hold"" work in the devops field at the moment. I wouldn't expect that to last as the industry defines what is and isn't good practice a bit more.

Where? And what are their sources? Because I'm not seeing it. I'm 35 myself and if anything the demand for my skills is growing because there's just relatively few people who have the experience I have. I graduated in 2002 so I've been working full time professionally for 13 years (and 2 years or so part time before that). And not just that; I've been working as a consultant for the last 10 years or so so I've seen a lot of different problems that I had to solve.

How do you think that compares to a junior just out of school? 

Some companies try to hire as many juniors as possible because they're a lot cheaper. They see code as something you produce by the hour and don't really understand development. And then there's companies that learned, some way, that this isn't the way it works. That you need experienced devs to build complex software just as much as you need an experienced doctor to do a heart transplant. 

People who are 30-50 and have a hard time finding a job simply didn't keep track of their career. If you worked as a ""programmer"" and all you did was maintain a bunch of SQL reports for 30 years, of course you're not as much in demand as you hoped you'd be. But how relevant is a docter who only knows bloodletting as a technique?

I haven't seen any ageism at all.

Due to employment nondiscrimination laws, they can't just ask ""hey, are you pregnant or planning to be soon, or do you have a baby or toddler?"", but believe me, some employers will do everything short of that to clearly try and find out.

So anyway, I really started to notice that once I hit 30. However, I don't think it's necessarily affected my rates of actually getting jobs, nor my rate of being recruited, but the fact that employers seem so concerned about it does make me wonder whether the average woman in her 30s is less likely to be hired than a similar man of the same age.

Absolutely.  After 1-2 years of experience, recruiters will start to reach out to you.

Further, if you do good work, and make friends on the job (or elsewhere, like meetup), you begin to develop a network of references and connections.  These references make it that much easier to ""skip the recruitment line.""

The best answer I can give is that there IS and ISN'T some type of ageism.

Some companies I've seen want to hire developers fresh from college as they're cheaper than more experienced counterparts, but they won't have developed the bad habits that come with experience sometimes.  They're also more agreeable to working 12 to 15 hour days plus weekends.


Other companies want only experienced personnel because they don't want train-up time with various toolsets or environments, but beware of firms that want 5 years experience and still label the position as ""junior"" or ""associate"".


The best input I can give is to stay current on your skills and learn new skills from watching trends.

There's a perspective you get as you get farther along in your career, and it's that you don't really know the things you *thought* you new before.

Essentially, overconfidence in what you know is a telltale sign of someone early in their computer science career.  As you progress in your career, you become much more aware of what you know and don't know, and the things that you previously categorized in the ""I'm an expert!"" category were clearly overstated.

Experience brings a more cautious approach; instead of jumping into a project after seeing 2 examples working, thinking you are now a master of this new framework / language / area of expertise, experience tells us there's a lot more behind the scenes to understand before boldly proceeding because we've been burned too many times before.

While younger programmers interpret this as an inability to learn / lack of ingenuity / whatever, our perspective is one of distrusting what we know until we get some real experience on it, because we've learned that the devil is in the details.

That's my perspective.  I used to call myself ""the cowboy"", I'd pick up a manual for a new language in the afternoon, stay up all night coding, and think I'd have a masterpiece by the following morning.  Now, I see the folly in that.  The end product was unpolished and unreliable much of the time due to lack or true understanding of what was going on behind the scenes.

Today, I take a much more cautious approach because my priorities have changed.  I want things to work reliably, I want to understand the intimate details of the environment so that I can support my product and make sure that what I'm doing doesn't have any unintended consequences.

Back in the day (in America anyways), when you turned 18, you instantly became a man, and were no longer considered a ""boy.""  Liberals' collective aggressive assault on our morals, our cultural values, and our traditions have succeeded far worse than apparently thought, if people even in Sweden no longer consider 18+ to be a man, but still a boy.

What I mean by this is, the communist colleges and universities in America have over the past few decades, succeeded in convincing society that 18-22 year olds are not ""adults"" but are in fact ""children"" who need to be babysat and have their hands held, and be stripped of their civil liberties and given over to a nanny state ""for their own good."" It is this infectious communism and pussification culture that has resulted in people no longer taking 18-22 year olds seriously, and treating them like overgrown children.

This is one of the many reasons why it's very hard for 22 year-old college graduates in America to be taken seriously when they try to get into entry-level jobs.  They have their resumes tossed arbitrarily by the hiring managers and recruiters who regard them as being inexperienced infants and ninny schoolchildren who are barely mature enough to accept the responsibility of holding down a fulltime job.

After all, being an amazing engineer clearly means you would be a great manager, right? And managers add SOO much more value than good engineers, so you should totally have to move in that direction!

Oh, wait...that's STUPID! A good senior engineer adds tons more value than a mid-level manager. And the skills he has been learning, and the experience he has been gaining are largely non-transferable to management. It leaves developers either having to accept career stagnation, stop doing what they love/are good at, or move into consulting of some sort.

Luckily, more and more companies are recognizing this, and providing true engineering career paths. I think both IBM and Microsoft (among others) allow you to achieve upper management level equivalency as engineers.

I especially like how Microsoft actually has entry level management roles. 

Lower/mid-level management should not be considered a ""higher rank"". It's just another job that has to get done. It has its own skill set, and isn't necessarily harder, or easier, than any other job. If anything, lower/mid level management has a lot LESS impact on the company than engineers do.

I get that, that isn't true for upper management, which can (especially at large companies) have an extreme level of impact on a companies profits and culture. That's why CEOs and the like make so much.

Why is ageism so unbelievable? People have all sorts of biases, and age is a pretty common one to have. It's easy to not believe in something until it affects you. Trying to debate that ageism exists on this sub is like trying to convince someone that man-made climate change is a thing. I have no idea why so many people here are so unwilling to entertain the idea or are so dismissive of it.

Don't listen to the college aged kids and the 24 years olds saying ""Well, I never experienced ageism and I have never seen it. Therefore it doesn't exist"". Like, of course they wouldn't experience it. They are not at the age where they become the target of ageism in tech. But it definitely exists. And no, just because the 20-something-year-old met a couple old people that are still working in tech, that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

A senior developer like yourself would easily make 120k to 160k and it's fairly low cost of living here.

Also, I have a few recommendations. 

1. Attempt to talk to someone in HR before submitting a resume, and try to figure out who you can email your resume to directly. If you blindly submit your resume to an online form, chance of any call back is slim, even if you are an ideal candidate.

2. Limit your resume to 1 pages, 2 pages max! I did a lot of hiring at my previous job and I found it difficult to skim through long resumes and figure out if the person has relevant experience because there was so much irrelevant information. If the job is for React web development, tell me about other jobs where you were doing React development, not some C++ job from 10 years ago. Sure it's good experience, but if hiring a React developer and I get 5 other resumes that say React right up front, I'll probably self your resume. 

3. Your resume should be custom tailored to every job you apply to. Pick out the keywords from the job posting and go through your master resume (which has all of your experience) and trim down to only show relevant experience and relevant technologies. Kinds goes back to #2, limit to a page by listing relevant technologies you know and maybe 3 -4 jobs and the job bullet points should be listing how you used those technologies you have listed above in your resume.

I’m going to give more anecdotal evidence here, but from a different (not necessarily unique) perspective. 

I work at a major company (Think Verizon, but with more blue) and am a “team lead.” Within my organization, that puts directly me over senior, standard and junior developers while being in charge of architectural, solution, and personnel decisions. That said, I’m only 25 and I make a pretty decent chunk of money; 150k in a medium CoL area.

With that preface out of the way, I want to echo what a lot of folks in here have said: it’s not your age, it’s your experience. Recruiters just assume you won’t work for cheap, and if you do it will just be to hold you over to your next “real” job. Most recruiting companies don’t really care to talk to me once they learn how much money I make. It’s not because that suddenly makes me older, but because I’m expensive. 

It’s a fair assumption that someone with 10+ years on their resume is quite expensive. Recruiters are looking to find as many candidates in as short a time period as possible. Theyre head hunters. Why would they take you, a candidate that will possibly leave in a few months for a leadership position, when they can get some guy that has been a happy code monkey for awhile. They only get commission if you stay put for a set period.

Likewise, think about a company; why would they *want* you? Not trying to be mean, but you’ve been in the industry for awhile, you should be rather high in the management chain. Why aren’t you? And if you fix your resume to say you were but now you don’t want to be, why not? Are you not capable of leading? If I need you to step up, are you going to bow out? I’m not going to hire you, if that’s the case.

The reason I put my history on here is because of my anecdotal experience. People see my resume and assume I’ve trimmed it down to be short. Then they see a 25 year old on skype or in person and immediately turn me down. And I don’t think it’s because I’m 25, but they know I don’t have the experience they’re looking for. I’m not some grizzled vet, and while I may be worth it, they’re not willing to take that chance.

Your situation is the same, but reverse. You’re not some bright-eyed developer, you’re a grizzled veteran whose been in the game for awhile. You might be worth it, but a lot of folks aren’t willing to take that chance.

Your best bet is definitely consultant at this point, if you’re not interested in management. Also, if you find yourself in management again, don’t be a discriminatory dick.

Well likewise, a person who spent the last 10 years at the same job doing mostly the same thing could be assumed/prejudiced to be stuck in their ways, unable to learn/relearn/unlearn certain skills, have a very narrow scope of experience, have a senior mentality and be resistant to management, and not be up-to-date on current tech.

This is definitely part of it. Of course, it's a flawed piece of reasoning, but I can guarantee this is what's going through the heads of hiring managers and potential interviewers screening the resume.

The reality is CTO and VP positions are rare. There's obviously only a single CTO per company. Small companies may not have any VPs at all; if they do, it'll just be one or two. Larger companies may have lots of VPs, but being a CTO/VP at a small company doesn't necessarily translate to being a VP at a huge corporation (in fact, it flatly does not translate).

But when you're looking at a resume, you don't necessarily think of the above. You just see someone whose previous job was several levels above your own, and you don't see why they'd be on your team reporting to you. You figure they must have screwed up or been incompetent or something.

I won't put up my exact location on this throwaway because I don't want it linked back to my main account that I occasionally use for business.  I will say I live out west, in a desert community.

Web dev.  I started web development with my first contract in 94 or 95.


Very well.  Usually between 75-100% compatible.  But I also apply for the unicorn ads in case they're flexible on requirements.


1/200 or fewer.


Most of them, actually.  If I can get a response, I can usually get a call.  Unless there is a problem with location.


All of the above.  I'm not really too picky, as long as it's legal and I have the skills.  I was picky before, but that goes away with longer unemployment.


A few years ago, almost none gave me tests.  Lately, almost all.  I do ok on take home, even landed one job after learning two parts of their stack I'd never used professionally.  Unfortunately, they rescinded the offer when I wanted to talk about a clause in their contract.  They didn't even want to discuss and rescinded.

I can't attest to anyone else, but I can explain why I don't personally believe it.  
The biggest issue for me is that I've never seen any proof of ageism.  It's generally some random person coming in here, like OP, with their anecdotal evidence.  And it's normally shit evidence.  OP didn't get a job for 7 months - must be ageism...come on.  
My anecdotal evidence directly contradicts theirs.  I see older people (myself included) in software positions constantly.  This includes my current position where I am the youngest at well over 30.  
Additionally - my entire career has been post 30.  Never felt like I was the victim of ageism.  


How is this logically any different from saying ""It happened to me, therefore it must happen to everyone, everywhere.""?  Anecdotal is anecdotal, regardless which side of the argument it is used.  



Goes a lot further proving it doesn't exist than:  


goes to prove it does.  

There are certainly ageist people and companies out there.  Certain groups might even be more prone (like silicon valley/startup culture) to it - but that doesn't make it a wide spread, industry wide problem.

Which is of course totally not the case.  I stay at jobs for a long time, probably too long.


Why would they want me?  Good question.  I thought about this a while back and realized that I probably wouldn't put my resume at the top of the stack if I were looking for a regular or even senior developer.

Why am I not higher in the food chain?  Choice.  I went to school to learn to code, I've spent most of my career coding, have tried moving higher, and didn't like it.  In fact, I believe it affected my mental well-being.  I wouldn't mind being a manager in another industry, but not in tech.  I did it well, we met or exceeded expectations, but board of director's meetings is not what I went to school for, and not what I want to do.  The problem is, it's very difficult to get that across in a resume or cover letter without sounding negative, bitter, or some other unwanted attitude.  And then there's still the thought, ""will he change his mind and be bored?""

I don't like hiding things from my resume.  I worked hard for that experience, but I figured I had to do what I had to do.  Problem is, as you said, it all falls apart when you have your first in person.  I may not act grizzled or have grizzled person goals, but I sure as fuck look grizzled.

I like your post.  I didn't find that part to be mean at all.  It's reality, and sometimes it hits you at unexpected ages.  I don't blame the industry.  I don't even blame the people who foster this behavior.  They're trying to make as much money as they can to either survive or make shareholders happy.

I want to learn more.. hell I am trying to cram my head with new devops and front end UI stuff right now to get past my Java backend stigmatism and look more desirable.

I unfortunately have seen a lot more of the ""i am better than you old man"" than the ""lets work and kick ass together"" sort of behavior. Honestly.. I know I am probably biased because I see how my own kids who are in teens/early college age, have this sort of the world is owed to me attitude because many of us my age gave them everything and uh oh they got a booboo and what do you mean no trophy for last place crap that has been going on, and I feel like this is partly what I am starting to see in the work force.

I'm going to guess some pretty well populated area but not a tech hub.  This is a problem, you're at a disadvantage in the whole process.  You can't do an onsite without a round trip ticket and not the same day ""swing by and have coffee"" deal.


Crowded, you'd have to have advance API dev, custom backends and/or industry specific knowledge to stand out.


You must fix this very soon.  I've been doing challenges ""here and there"", I use YouTube and others, just pick one a day or so, but fully understand that one, then move on.  Just knowing 20~30 changes the odds as you can re-use solutions and you'll have a ""plan of attack""


So it's ""some college"" because CS wasn't in HS ""back in the day"".

So, few more questions:

Q1. what would it take to finish college?  How far did you get and can you do this online?

Q2. the companies giving you tests, that's pre 1/200?  Meaning you're getting more than 1 out of 200 that are asking you to take a leetcode type test?  I ask because these are pretty automated and should be given out like candy.  So I'm wondering if doing better on those gets you past 1/200 and more toward 30/200.

Discussion: the degree has maybe two things, GE and CS/MIS/...  If you finished the GE and have some CS, you should be close.  Might be 1 semester or even some online.

The location you should at some point make a decision on this.  A long time friend of mine moved from NorCal to LA to North West and is now at $165K/yr doing the servers for medical claims processing.  He moved a number of times to make things work and I'm not sure he always got compensation for moving.

I don't know the exact languages but here's a problem that might be there.  If you're into Web Dev, you could be competing against everyone HS~college kid that's just starting out.  I say this because a lot of web dev starts in HS.  What they don't usually have is full server/ custom API dev mixed with paid professional experience.  Even if some of that experience is old.  Example: I was the SQL DBA/ server manager for a very large company.  Even thou that was a while back, it still looks good and can edge you in.

302,302,4,cscareerquestions,"Ageism in tech? I didn't believe it at first, but now am wondering. What do you think?",e9ley0h,"No problem! The online form submissions are notoriously bad because HR departments typically have software which scans through your resume to find keywords...and usually the HR person is setting the keywords...so I might tell HR to find someone with an  Angular background and HR types AngularJs as one of the keywords, which if you are an Angular dev you know AngularJs means version 1.x which is basically a different framework than Angular (which means version 2+ and I believe version 7 just came out). So there is a big difference between Angular and AngularJs. Job description might say Angular so you make sure you have Angular listed on your resume but HR messes up and types AngularJs as one of the filter terms so now your resume is never found because you never listed AngularJs in your resume. Then even if you come up as a match in their system, the HR person isn't really qualified to know if you have the right skillset or not so you might get weeded out just because they don't know what they are looking for exactly beyond keyword matching (they aren't technical). And depending on the company, they may or may not have their email form configured correctly on their site so your emails end up in someone's inbox who is on vacation or not even working for the company anymore. You can quickly see there is a lot of red tape before your resume ends up in the hands of a dev manager who is actually qualified to determine whether it is worth it to give you a call and start the interview process. It is more akin to a lottery system, because the best candidates don't always get selected.

If you can get on a call with HR, they can at least ask you some questions which most of your answers should be ""yes I have experience with X language/framework"" and then they will say, go ahead and send me your resume and I'll forward it along to the dev manager...because you just qualified yourself to HR and now go past all the obstacles and red tape. 

I use to blindly submit to those form submissions on the company websites but got no calls and barely an email to  say no. But then I started calling the companies and asking to speak to HR because ""I submitted the my resume through the form on the website but the website had an error message so I just wanted to make sure it was received okay""...which this forced the HR person to actually look in their database and find my resume, at which point they could quickly see I had some of the keywords they were looking for....then I would ask then a question or 2 about the job if they didn't start asking me prescreening type questions....then usually the conversation would naturally end with them saying they would turn my resume over to the dev manager. That had a very high successful rate.

A few times I even showed up to the company in person with my resume. That method is hit or miss. Some people get really annoyed by it while others love the enthusiasm and sometimes do an interview on the spot.

TLDR: Anytime you can get on the phone with someone, you can increase your chances of your resume actually making it into the right hands.

I was thinking.. you know what I should do.. go speak at companies with youngsters.. or even colleges... and stress.. how difficult it is today. When I was starting out.. 20 years ago there was a massive shortage of developers and tons of money and ideas/companies... today.. apparently there is still a massive shortage.. but I find companies are SUPER picky who they hire now. I dont blame them.. but at the same time, there is WAY more competition today for developers than 20 years ago. Oddly..the money has barely gone up. In fact, when I was starting out, I worked with contractors that were making upwards of 300 an hour. They were 3 month to 6 month stints.. but that was insane. Today, if you can find contract for > 100 an hour that is impressive. Yet, costs have gone way up.. dont understand that one. Guess more supply of developers/competition has greatly decreased pay levels since developers are ""a dime a dozen"" today. Still pays well enough though in most areas, just not much more than I was making 20 years ago. 
But.. I was thinking.. though I dont like the idea of ""big brother"" in our Govt (US specifically but probably world wide), it would be almost good for an enforcement of a 401K plan like taxes that comes out of your check no matter what. With the supposed social security (in US) going away in 20 years or less, it seems to me one of the most important things anyone in the workforce today but especially those starting out could or absolutely musst learn is saving for the future. Its too bad we dont have an automatic/guarantee as you get a year older you work 5 minutes less per day and get 1 extra vacation day per year. By the time you have put 30 years in, you have 40+ days vacay, and working 5 hour days... to match the fact that most of us as we get older learn less/slower, work slower, need more healthcare/sleep/etc... and should be able to retire with a decent living.. assuming you didnt do stupid stuff to get in to debt.
But I am blown away in my kids schools they learn nothing about money, the real world, jobs, etc. I dont know why we havent mandated as part of school they must do a job at school, balance money, pay bills, etc.. because it is only getting harder today than ever, with automation (no thanks to those of us that write code that eventually replaces jobs), less jobs, more competition, etc. Maybe I should write a book!

If you've already completed the GE, you're about 1/2 way there.  My degree is MIS, it comes from the schools of business, it has probably the most programming without being CS, and is mainly on project management and systems analysis.

I think there were some 10~12 classes, past GE stuff.  It's been a good while.

The upside is that you should already know this stuff.  It's like saying you need to take a driver's ed class.  You've been driving for many years, why would a driver's ed class be very hard?

Here's the deal, you are asking some company to invest in you because you are at the level of a professional programmer.  You don't have the degree, which most professional programmers have.  So you're asking them to go out on a limb for you because you're claim is you have the skills/knowledge...

If you actually do have the skills/knowledge, the classes directly related to programming should be a walk in the park.  In addition, the leetcode tests shouldn't be that hard.  I know for me I just switch languages and they didn't do test in Swift at the time.  It sucked because I was now new at a new language that wasn't used by Amazon and some others.

So I had to pickup yet another language.

One point is that if hired, one side is claiming they can do the work, the other side has to trust that they can, yet one side doesn't have the common level of proof (the degree) and is competing against people that can have the degree and years of experience in an area that's been flooded since the DotCom crash.

When DotCom hit, everyone was a web dev.  HS kids with a laptop were web devs.  Everyone was learning Java.

You're in the greatest economy you've ever seen in your life and you're trying to get into one of the hottest jobs the world knows and you're not sure if you want to take classes for stuff you should know like the back of your hand.

If I were to ask you how to merge onto the freeway, would it really be that hard?  You've merged onto the freeway a million times.

How many web pages have you developed?  How many servers have you setup?  If you have that level of experience, you should be able to do that in your sleep.


Based on this, they are passing you up because of location and education.  This is without seen the resume and if there's any big names on there as well as how well it's written.

Just for a frame of reference, there's been a few posts on here where devs with 3~5 years are getting calls non-stop.

One last note, back in the day, I heard of people challenging classes for credit.  I know that Stanford and other offer online credit.  I've taken Yale, Harvard, MIT and Stanford classes several times, I just don't pay for the credit.

You take the class online and the in class test should be a walk in the park.

498,498,5,cscareerquestions,Is ageism prevalent in this industry?,i4yvbaw,"Oops sorry I forgot I was getting too much spam via DM and disabled it. 

I originally went to university for CS but dropped out and never got a degree. Stumbled into testing and grew to team lead and manager through that. Spent a lot of that part of my career trying to get in earlier in the SDLC, and managed to get a lot of the devs around me to realize if they involved me in design I could break their design before they started coding when it's so much faster and cheaper to fix. I spent time being a test manager without a team (coordinating/influencing other teams) and eventually evolved to technical project manager without really noticing. 

Last role I had was back as testing manager before someone I'd worked with a decade ago reached out to me about becoming a dev manager - something I hadn't really considered until then. 

So maybe I'm not the example you're looking for because I haven't become an individual contributor developer who spends their day coding - I'm involved only so far down as the design level but I would not be effective at implementation. While most people in testing invested their time learning automation, I spent more of my time on people and project than coding. I did also completely jump industries at the same time too. From mobile firmware, radio and security right into web dev. Huge transition moving into dev and into a different industry at the same time, but the company I'm at doesn't pay top dollar so they're more willing to take a chance on someone like me. I love the team, the company, the work and at this point in my life that's more important. 

I also didn't set out to become a tester, a TPM, or dev manager - but both testing and project management are on on the decline so it was the right move for me.

The biggest ageism I see is the use of leetcode type questions for interviews.  This is stuff I mostly haven't touched in 20 years.  When I graduated, I was the king of these - now I have forgotten most it.  Unfortunately, this is a big factor.  I think this is a nice, easy way to discriminate against those with young families (who can't spend the time re-learning this), or people who have been out of the college for a while.  The Department of Labor would have no idea that reversing a binary tree in 20 minutes on coderpad has little correlation with deploying and running a system on AWS, so they can get away with it.  

But that's the only one I experienced.  There could be some that I cannot perceive.  For example, I'm less than 10 miles away from Apple.  I had applied to about 5-10 positions that I am more or less perfect for, including a weird mix of old and new technologies that hardly anybody would have.  But no response from them.  This is probably because they have tons of candidates, but you can't help but wonder if it is age discrimination.  I will never know.

Other than that, I found that interviewers are fine.  But everyone's unique.  My skillset is very current, so I didn't have that issue.  Sure, there are those that struggle, but many of them have not kept their skill set up to date.  I mean, someone can be an expert of SQL, but not knowing NoSQL disqualifies you from a lot of data jobs these days.

In terms of ""long hours"", I actually found many of those in their 40s more willing to do that than many in their 20s.  Those that are married and have kids that are grown a bit are more likely to not bat an eye when there's a 8AM and 10PM meeting with the office in India for example.  

Overall though, the stereotype that older people are unemployable is kind of false.  Companies good workers.  The Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google's of the the world may treat young workers as exploitable commodities that can be used and disposed of at their whim, but most other companies need good workers.",SomeGuyInSanJoseCa,,False,t3_bt7xtl,t3_bt7xtl,False,26,05-26-2019,0.8952,6.0,5.0,0.49,"work, people, year, old, time, age, also, tech, young, experience"

&#x200B;

Here is the deal after what you will see a decade into work: you will either want to be a technically proficient person or you want to be in leadership. Hopefully you are at a firm that 1. actually distinguishes between the two and 2. are ok with the course of action you want to take realizing you can do both but won't be as good as you can be when you have to multi task. 

&#x200B;

Then comes a whole new set of challenges for either.

&#x200B;

 For the technical proficiency it is learning by doing, documenting and sharing as well as refactoring what you have done. It is gaining more technical acumen to be put onto hard projects everyone wants. The solution is to do projects no one wants and to continue to get solutions. 

For the leadership track, this can be a whole other world. Budgets, balance sheets, culture, teams, leading leaders versus managing resources.  Be the first and be a leader. Sometimes being a leader means you have to make hard calls and stand by decisions. If I was not willing to get fired for doing the right thing, then I am of no use to lead. 

&#x200B;

BTW, I'm 2+ decades in.  I lead leaders so my technical day to day coding has gone down a lot. I still work on side projects  and explore new technology but it is not my day to day. My job is to act as lead blocker for my department, work with program management on what is up for the next quarter and to tactically devise roadmap for the next couple of quarters out. 

&#x200B;

Where the challenges come in is actually wanting to pare back and role creep.  I interviewed recently and a few very well known firms and they wanted me to scale up a lot in terms of responsibility. I had applied to roles to scale back and so we had to hash out with them I have no want to lead a big group they were offering but a very small one.

I struggled from around age 55 on. My hiring managers were typically 35-40. The last 10 years until my retirement at 65, I worked about 40% of the time, usually three-month contracts that were almost never renewed.

How do I know it was ageism? From the faces of the people at the in-person interview after the successful phone interview. *Eyes glaze over.* Disappointment. A short, unfriendly interview and no job offer.

I removed everything from my resume that indicated my age, like my graduation years. I removed a couple decades of experience; it was old tech that wasn't helpful anyway, just identified me as an old guy. That helped get me interviews.

I was blond until about age 40; by 50 my hair was white. I dyed my hair blond, which blended well with the white and looked pretty natural but helped me look younger.

This is my personal values and our standard

New hire or existing employee:

RELEVANT and DIVERSE technical experience for the role will give a leg up to be interviewed or keep you there/help you be promoted

,but the technical experience and even more importantly the BEHAVIORAL skills have to pass and maintain a higher bar for more experienced people

AGE IS NOT A FACTOR

Individual contributors with a lot of experience regularly make more than the managers managing them. There are more spots to be a highly experienced and well-paid engineer than a manager.

Now, here are some reasons why a very experienced engineer may find it hard to get in or stay in a tech company:

- Not staying up-to-date with very fast changing & business-relevant technology and high-value/impact projects/teams

- Stuck in their ways BEHAVIORALLY and assuming they can just do what they want because of their technical experience

- Not understanding that with more experience and more pay, there are even HIGHER expectations to  stay at the peak of the individual contributor engineer track

- Not understanding that you have to have influence and impact relevant to your role WITHOUT being a manager/the people authority

Management/people leadership track has different expectations and not as much change. There is also A LOT of support from company systems. 

The reality is naturally as humans, we age and with age our lower energy and mental capacities leads to the above reasons.

In nearly every case I've seen where people have remained unemployed and blamed ageism, the real problem has been outdated skillsets. Sometimes severely outdated skillsets. 

I literally just had a conversation with a guy last month who was complaining about not being able to find a job after more than 25 years of programming. He blamed ageism. When I asked him about the quality of his public repos, I learned that he had no idea how to use Github and that the ONLY source management application he'd ever used was Microsoft Visual Sourcesafe (his employer apparently tried to move to SVN after SS was retired, but they gave up on it and moved to a network share system...yikes). He'd spent the last 15 years creating .Net Web Forms apps for his previous employer and had no idea how modern application development worked. As in, no Agile, never written a test, never worked in any sort of cloud environment, etc. His skillset was straight out of 2005. 

I've had this same conversation more times than I can count with other developers my age. It's easy to blame ageism, but the reality of the industry is that it's a never-ending rabbit chase. If you stop learning the latest technologies and techniques and stop trying to keep up with the industry, you stop being relevant.

FWIW, the guy is now getting ready to start a 24-week programming bootcamp to update his skills and learn how things are done in the modern era.

I'm a 47 year old UX designer, and I'll tell you when I'm looking at potential places to work, I'm being a bit more selective. I'm looking for places that are not big companies where everyone is a number, and there isn't a long hours culture. 

Right now I'm working for a B2B software company and I'm happy. It doesn't have the pizzazz of a Facebook, Google, or Apple, but I get done with work at 5:00 on most days, and can live my life. Even one of my managers stated he believes in good mental health, and thus pushes away any thoughts of long hours culture. 

There are companies out there that are going to cling to this idea that only youth can do this work, but then there are others who simply either want someone with a better work ethic and more longevity, or these companies simply don't have the luxury to be that selective. 

Also, I found in this line of work that as you get older, many companies expect you to get more into a thinking and decision making role and not so much of a ""worker bee"" or ""doer"" role. A lot of companies will see someone with 20+ years of experience and would rather they be making decisions, leading, and mentoring as opposed to just plopping into a chair and writing code. 

Be aware of that. If you have decades of experience, you might want to make sure you consider managerial roles. Somebody who avoids them oftentimes doesn't look good to a company. If you are older and do not have a lot of experience, just step away from the companies that all the youth are chasing, and you'll find many places more open and willing and even liking the idea of an older worker. I know the CEO of my company likes me because I have a hard work ethic while he sees many youth jump ship very quickly.",InternetArtisan,UX Designer,False,t3_obckyy,t3_obckyy,1625141449.0,12,07-01-2021,0.9714,21.0,21.0,0.5177,"work, get, go, company, time, make, want, year, job, career"

It's not unique to engineering, but it 100% exists in tech, and there are numerous industries where you're likely to see a distrust of people of certain ages.

The experience argument doesn't really hold weight, because many industries aren't capable of hiring people with 10+ years experience due to cost. There's a reason why the cool startup with the ping pong table or the agency with ""fly by the seat of your pants"" painted in a mural in their breakout room is mostly people under 30, and that's because they are limited to hiring people that lack experience. Sure, you could say ""oh boo-hoo it's their fault"", but the industry isn't perfect, and if you wanted to work in a startup you might find that you're either severely undervaluing yourself, or working in a place that's a poor cultural fit.

Again, you might say that it doesn't matter because ""Software Engineers are well-paid"", and the answer to that is ""lol no"". The world doesn't begin and end with America, and you might find that well-paid is a misnomer, because they could live in a HCOL city in their own country and be nowhere near affording a house, saving for retirement, etc. It's painful that this needs to be said, but /r/cscareerquestions and Blind is in no way representative of the real world. Guess what? Some experienced people in the UK and Europe might only get paid around £35-40k a year. In places with a lower cost-of-living it might be substantially less.

With that being said, this isn't unique to Software Engineering. To illustrate how common this is, there is literally an episode of Friends about this and the advertising industry. Ageism exists everywhere, and you'll likely find that it's treated the same in our field as it is in others - people will gravitate towards certain industries with a good cultural fit, and those places will likely match what they expect from a job. If you've got a decade of experience and you're looking to use that experience, you're probably not going to work in a small company that isn't going to utilise that experience and wants to do things in a lean way.

Tbh, we just had a new crop of junior guys join and I have narrowly averted at least a dozen near disasters  the last few months by heading things off before they did something really dumb. Some of those things would have just been a complete waste of time, but others would have likely caused production issues. Some of it was just efficiency-  I saw a guy trying to make an update to 600 entities yesterday and it took about 30 minutes for it to run. With a little bit of additional knowledge and some sed magic, after about ten minutes of changes it ran in about 30 seconds (instead of running commands over the network one by one sequentially, I batched them up for each instance, and then reached out to each host in parallel) I feel more valued than ever.

Ageism is more of a problem in big names; Fortune 500s are full of engineers in midlife or near retirement. I strongly believe ageism is such a problem in big tech because of, in order of effect size:

1. The huge salaries we're paid, allowing a significant proportion of the FAANGMULA workforce to FIRE before 50, exacerbating the appearance. 
2. Because most big names expect a higher level of dedication to the job than the average big corp and have worse WLB than many people with families desire.

I feel like the rate in which my fingers type words has decreased over time and I only have 4 yoe. I'm not sure whether I should be concerned about this at all because I'm pretty obsessed nowadays with trying to write effective code while periodically making sure what I'm doing is in line with the bigger picture instead of just typing out code trying to implement a ticket.

I feel like my velocity has slowed down as a result compared to my more enthusiastic new grad self and get pretty scared of what I'll be when I'm 40.

I haven't made senior yet, so it feels like walking a tightrope between trying to build the right thing and actually doing.

We're comparing *average* SWEs with *experienced* (successful) professionals. It seems the definition of 'experienced' for an engineer is an average engineer with years of service, but the 'experienced' professional is a highly competent one who has experienced steep TC progression - the other professions' FAANG equivalent like Sidley or Skadden Arps or McKinsey engagement managers.

For the purposes of this comparison, I'm going to ignore workload (engineers have the least, even at Amazon) and include education where appropriate. 

* The average investment banker never progresses beyond analyst. Those that make vice president are pulling in $250k+$250k ($500k TC) or more. That's about FB E5. Directors and such make more, but anyone who gets into BB IBD in the first place is already FAANG equivalent, because IBD is incredibly competitive and places a high emphasis on school pedigree. 

* The average experienced lawyer doesn't work at biglaw or as internal counsel and makes $100k in private or small law office. Those who work at biglaw don't often make partner. Biglaw is more competitive than FAANG. The lawyers who make more than an experienced SWE have many more years of experience and 4 more years of schooling. Biglaw likewise weights heavily on law school prestige. The similarly experienced engineer is ahead of the biglaw associate.

* The average experienced physician doesn't begin work until his late 20s or early 30s depending on residency and specialty. The path to practice is more fraught, many medical school graduates taking several years to match a residency. However, once practicing, the entry-level physician immediately has a TC higher than the average experienced engineer, and far more as an anaesthesiologist or surgeon. The physician's TC growth is relatively small unless he becomes a medical director. However, doctors can make their money in many places beyond SF, Seattle, and NY. If you're ambitious and capable enough to be a doctor, you can get into FAANG. Nevertheless, the physician has the edge.

* The average MBB consultant must have gone to a tier 1 school, like biglaw or IB. He starts out making $120k. Most never make it to EM, but if he's good and stick around for 5 years he probably will. Now his TC is $250k with constant travel and no clear path upward. However, his exit opportunities are great. Neither SWE nor MBB have the edge here.

Anyone ambitious and intelligent enough to be a successful lawyer or physician could become an engineer, but not nearly every experienced engineer could become a successful lawyer or physician. MBB and IB are much more soft-skills focused, about networking and selling, and weight very heavily on school pedigree. MBB and SWE are orthogonal to each other in skills, personality, and entry requirements.",ThickyJames,Applied Cryptography,False,t3_obckyy,t1_h3r4yu5,1625962192.0,1,07-10-2021,0.9967,43.0,13.0,0.9956,"get, good, work, year, use, guy, make, experience, job, go"
679,679,7,cscareerquestions,Does ageism lead to an early end to careers for people majoring in CS?,h4r8yp2,"I am comparing like for like. You’re the one who brought up the claim that only elite jobs can compete with a decidedly standard (albeit a bit above average) professional income range of $100-150k. 

Really not sure where you’re going with the banking example. Most of the attrition at the analyst level is driven by more lucrative buyside jobs to the tune of 60%+ of most analyst classes at firms employing the majority of entry level bankers. These buyside jobs pay at the low end $175-200k and on the high end $250-400k 2 years out of school. Analysts who are performing averagely are free to stay on to ASO and beyond but not many tend to want to. Plenty of folks also peruse cushy, well-paid Corp Dev or Finance dept jobs if they want better WLB and typically enjoy faster promos than those without IB exp (aka more $$s sooner). Irregardless of all of that, the IB track still pays vastly more than an average SWE career - since, as you’ve rightly noted, the field is inherently elite to begin with.

The point is, average SWE careers aren’t special or inherently lucrative. Plenty of average professionals who have settled into their careers make the same as an average SWE who has settled into theirs. It’s not out of the ordinary at all for an average tenured accountant (PP or in-house), lawyer (PP or in-house), architect, ad agency pro, consultant (i.e. excl MBB/T2), engineer, HR dept professional, ops & supply chain dept professional, finance dept professional, B2B salesperson, commercial banker, wealth manager, R&D scientist, retail buyer, retail merchandiser, aircraft pilot, marketing dept professional, industrial designer, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, construction project manager, construction cost manager, real estate professional, commercial insurance broker, investment bank / investment firm middle office / back office dept professional and so on.. to make $100-150k a year as a professional well into their career. It is not at all a surprising figure. 

EDIT: you edited your post… will review and see if I need to add anything

1. FB E5 does not make the same as an IB VP on avg, FB E5 is roughly $300-450k vs $450-650k IB VP.

2. Nobody said anything about BigLaw or in-house jobs at major corporations or elite startups. Those both are inherently elite jobs that pay more than average SWE. Not sure why they’re mentioned. Aside from that, plenty of lawyers in regional commercial law firms serving middle market clients or even in smaller general practice outfits or in-house at middle market companies or even in government that make $100-150k or more. 

3. Being a physician is an inherently elite job that pays more than average SWE - yes, add’l schooling and debt but the security and scale of their income means they catch up pretty quickly. Not sure why this is mentioned.

4. MBB/T2 consulting is also an inherently elite career (inclusive of exit opps) that pays more than average SWE not sure why this is being put forward.

So, if you're passing through your thirties and aren't applying for jobs where you're responsible for keeping others on track ( vis as a manager or an advanced specialist ), there's some sense that you've passed through decades of life without growing professionally. 

Which makes you suspect and uncompetitive.

So, it's important to constantly push yourself to grow professionally. It's important to become increasingly reliable.

When I was in my twenties, I was more prone to conflict than I am now. I've become less emotional and more team oriented. 

Of course my technical skills are as polished as they can be at my age--and so my focus is shifting toward learning how to help any kind of person grow.

727,727,8,cscareerquestions,Ageism in Tech,dl6uvuj,"Imposter syndrome is huge--particularly if you're pushing yourself. Because, if you're pushing yourself, you *are* by definition actually a little bit of an imposter on some level. Which is totally okay.

So, to quote Mrs. Wong, if you don't have imposter syndrome yet--*you go out and get it*. If you don't have imposter syndrome, try taking the next job you can get and pushing yourself a little harder on that by doing more than the job asks. Or, pick up a personal project that is bigger than you can chew technically.

Or, if team oriented skills are where you need growth--and we all need growth there--try to offer a short session on programming in your community. The more people you can level up in a day, the better your personal development. Do be sure to charge money for the session, though. Money is magic: it activates people, even if they're the ones paying rather than the ones getting paid. 

The last, often very overlooked thing, is location. When I'm in Austin, I'm more successful than when I'm in LA. When I'm in LA, I'm more successful than when I'm in Columbus. And when I'm in Silicon Valley? Success trips over itself. 

Don't blame others for lack of growth. But--we *are* all only as capable of going as far as the people around us. So, going to where people customarily go far helps significantly. 

( For example, did you know the Nobel Prize is a contagious disease? People who know people who have one are *significantly* more likely to get one themselves. )

I had a manager, the CTO, who was in 50s. He had been in the industry and a manager at least since the late 90s. Very smart guy, he wrote proof of concept programs in C and Python, played around with Docker on the weekends and he could do data analytics with the best of them. He hired a lot of older back end developers. But he outright said he wouldn’t hire anymore “old” front end developers because they don’t have a modern design aesthetic and we were stuck in our ways.

I’ve seen many “Senior developers” who stayed at one company 10 to 15 years writing and maintaining old tech and couldn’t find a job when they got laid off. Most managers would rather hire someone young and inexperienced than someone old, out of touch, with the “wrong” experience.

I found out in my last bout of unemployment (laid off from company), that it HR or recruitment departments usually have a pecking order when looking for applicants.

First, they go to referrals.  Employees who come in with a resume and say *""you should consider my friend for the position""*.  It's why so many articles talk about networking, because companies are more inclined to talk to someone who's been ""vetted""...although it doesn't always work.

Second, anyone who applies via their own website.  So *Fantasy Company's* HR person will first look to see who applied at *fantasycompany.com/careers* before anything else. Most of this is to avoid paying fees to job sites like Monster and Indeed, but also because they tend to think those who go to their website to apply obviously took deeper interest in the company versus those who simply click the ""apply"" button and send out a canned cover letter and resume.

The third area are the job sites and/or recruiting firms. Many companies will spend the money to make a listing on those sites to collect resumes, but they treat these sites as ""backup plans"".  So if they have no referrals or people who directly applied, they'll turn to Indeed, Monster, etc.

The thing you need to realize though if they have a referral and a few good applicants from their site, they won't even look at what came through the job site.  So you could send an application through Indeed, and find out they never even looked at it due to already having a good amount of applicants from referrals and their own site.

This is why I always try to apply directly.  So I see an ad on Indeed, then I look up the site, find their careers section, and apply there.  I seemed to do a little better than just sending resumes through job sites.  Not to mention you get on their email lists and they'll send you openings.  Sometimes they're openings they don't list on sites like Indeed and Monster.

Now some companies won't do the ""careers"" or ""jobs"" section, and the only place you can seemingly apply is on a job site.  Go for it, but just check first if you can apply directly first.

I would still set up profiles on these sites, put in a resume, and make sure your LinkedIn is up to date. These are for the occasional few who will find you in searches and reach out, most of the time recruitment firms.  Some companies simply go straight to paying someone to find them an applicant, so it's your only way in.

785,785,9,cscareerquestions,Age discrimination in tech hiring,gfbjoe6,"Well, either of us can “believe” whatever we want, but that doesn’t change reality. It’s a classic “gravity problem”. You may not like it while you are falling from a 20 story building. But that doesn’t mean you’re not going to probably die once you hit the bottom. 

“Salary compression and inversion” is a real phenomenon. It’s well known that once you get into a company, HR policies takeover and there is often a cap on the raises you can get while at the same time when you hire new people, you have to hire them at market rates. Meaning your “loyalty” has been rewarded with substandard, below market pay while your company is bringing new employees in at market rate. 

The “wrong experience” is when you have a lot of old farts who have been at the company for years, been promoted to “architects” and refuse to listen to people who come in and say there is a better way. They become “expert beginner.”  The people who do care about their career end up leaving. The only people left are the people who refuse to change (the “Dead Sea Effect”). 

Then the people who were “loyal” finally wake up and see they were underpaid and out of touch and find it hard to get another job when they are either ready to leave or forced to leave. 

Companies don’t have to hire developers who haven’t kept their skills up. There are enough hungry young developers who are keeping up with technology and willing to run on the treadmill  and enough older developers who kept up with tech loft to be the “adult supervision”. 

I made the same mistake in 2008 at 35. When I stayed at a company for nine years and only made $7000 more in year 9 than year 2. 

During the next nine years, between changing jobs 5 tunes I made $70K more. 


Post Covid, my company announced a 10% pay cut and spoke all of the BS about a “shared sacrifice”. They also wanted us to be back in the office three months ago because “collaboration was important”. While they had private offices.

786,786,9,cscareerquestions,Age discrimination in tech hiring,gfbwg3s,"I think the real demarcation line is the biggest thing to ever hit our industry, the internet. If you got into computing before the internet really hit its stride, you grew up in a fundamentally different time with a fundamentally different tech scene, and if you haven't been on the job market in 20+ years, and haven't bothered to keep up, that's going to be a show stopper. Hell, in the 10 years I've been doing this, I've seen the last vestiges of desktop applications wither away while everything gets moved to both the cloud and the browser, and both of those shifts require knowledge far removed from hacking some desktop CRM together. In my experience, it's most prominent among .NET developers, who become fat and happy with processes they haven't had to really build on since the millennium. The other issue is cultural fit, and not in the sense that older folks don't go clubbing on the weekends or make Tik Toks; cultural in the sense that you're ossified in your ways, poo-poo all new software, and generally are a major drag on new ways of thinking. Ours is a vibrant, dynamic field, and you should always be challenging your preconceptions (that aren't based in fundamental mathematical truths).

But, all that out of the way, if you're an older dev who has bothered to stay abreast of changes, you are worth your weight in gold in most companies. My outfit collects those folks like Pokemon, and has to pay an arm and a leg for their knowledge just to stay competitive with the deluge of offers they get. Personally, I absolutely love working with them, because it's like talking to an Zen master when you need advice, and most of them don't have the compulsion to disseminate the r/iamverysmart material (or, be annoying dicks like Ryan in ""Halt and Catch Fire"" who think they're above it all) that, when present, tends to show up in new grads.

From 2001 until the end of 2008, two things happened. First, I got stuck technologically in 2001. In 2008 I was still doing a combination of C, C++, VB6, Perl, and VB6. VB6 was discontinued in 2002. I was also barely making $70K as I was getting 3% raises and the bonuses were being cut. 

I started looking for another job at 34 and found my skillset woefully out of date. I did get two offers within a month. One making $90K as a C++ developer (about average for the time - salaries weren’t crazy back then) and another where they were looking for someone with VB6 and C# skills since they were migrating to C#. I took the latter opportunity because I knew there were a lot more C# opportunities. Despite the fact that it paid $77K and was a solid mid level position.  

I muddled my way through the recession, learned C# in an out including all of the popular frameworks at the time (Web Forms, Linq2Sql, JQuery, WCF, etc).

When the company folded, I could easily get past the techno trivia C# interviews and found a job relatively quickly making $90K as a high-mid level developer - at 38 years old. It was at the time an F10 (non tech company). But they did believe in doing things “right”. I’m now 38 years old first learning about “proper” software engineering - code reviews, git, pull request, domain driven design, unit testing, etc.

After a lot of resume driven development and networking, I’m interviewing again. I’m getting a lot of offers for backend c# developers, and the most I can push for is $115K. So now in 2015, I’m 41 years old just crossing the six figure mark. By now, senior developers locally are making $135-$140K. 

I spent the next two years, polishing up my soft skills and learning how to speak like an “architect.”  

I am back on the job hunt in late 2016. Finally ready to take a chance on getting a lead position. The only thing I can find is a contract to perm position because no one  except this one company would take a chance on me - at 42 years old to lead a team. I left a full time position, got on my wife’s insurance and took the job. 

By the end of 2017, at 43, the company decided to “move to the cloud”. I didn’t know anything about AWS and they hired some “consultants”. I read up on AWS and saw what they were making and I found my next goal. 

Now, I’m back on the job hunt again for the fifth time since 2008. I’m looking for a job where I can get some AWS experience. Recruiters are asking me do I have any experience with “newer technologies”. Alarm bells are going off. I’m 43 years old and I’m about to be back in the position I was in nine years prior - an out of touch old developer. 

I turned down an offer as a dev lead working with an on prem C#/Windows application and took a job that was a lateral salary move making $15K less. They were looking for a senior developer with C# experience. They were completely hosted on AWS and the new CTO wanted them to be “cloud native”. I got the job, jumped on every AWS initiative, learned Python, learned Node/express., Docker, and studied everything about AWS and best practices implementing solutions in the cloud. 

Now, it’s 2020, I’m about to turn 46, Covid hits along with a pay cut and I was contacted by a recruiter at AWS about a remote “cloud consulting” position. Of course I jumped all over it. But still, I’m 46 and while my total compensation is far outside the range of local salaries for individual contributors, I  am still making about the same as someone four or five years out of school who got hired directly into $BigTech. 

This isn’t a pity party. But, I’ve been very careful after 2008 about keeping my finger on the technology landscape and making sure I’m in sync with it.

First, I’m going to discount shitty startups—that’s another topic for another day.

It’s *really* important to understand that almost no employer *actually* cares about how well you program (i.e. how clean or efficient your code is). *You* might benefit from improving that skill, in part because you’re going to have to maintain what you create, and/or what your counterparts write (so influencing them in a positive fashion is usually a good idea), but that really does only go so far. The typical interview process tends to belie that fact, but that’s because interviews are mostly conducted by developers who haven’t the slightest clue how to interview and are mostly aping the very same process that they were exposed to when *they* were hired, and so the process perpetuates itself. There is, nevertheless, a disconnect between what they’re looking for and what their employers actually want.

For this reason among others, most developers inevitably fall into the trap of thinking that they’re valuable because they can program…and, therefore, that the better they program, the more valuable they are. However, with a few (fairly obvious) exceptions, that’s completely wrong. In business lingo, “programmer” is synonymous with “code monkey.” If you optimize for that skill, and if you think of (and market) yourself as a programmer, you’re quickly slotting yourself into a fungible role that is uniquely susceptible to all sorts of pretty nasty market forces—including the fact any reasonably talented 22 year old CS graduate can do the very same thing to a satisfactory standard, but at half the price (all while being considerably more susceptible to abuse and coercion). 

Again, you may be much better at writing actual code than that new grad, but that skill is *not* worth twice as much money to your employer. **This is true even at most major tech companies,** let alone their seemingly mundane counterparts. Amazon, for example, is tracking towards a one TRILLION dollar market cap with hundreds of billions per year in revenue, despite the fact that a great deal of their code is absolute shit (I’ve seen plenty of it; I worked there). It does what it needs to do, all the same.

So, if you’re beyond 40—let alone 50—and you’re still focusing on programming at the expense of much else, it will become increasingly difficult for you to find (and maintain) employment, even in places that aren't already rife with subconscious biases (like those shitty startups I alluded to earlier). That’s the simple truth. Somebody will probably hire you somewhere, but your career and income will stagnate and gradually even begin to decline.

What *will* distinguish you and keep your career alive just about as long as you’d like it to last is learning how to spot, understand, and ultimately solve expensive or lucrative business problems in any way possible, whether that involves writing code and developing software in general or not (in today’s world, it often does--so as a *supplementary* skill, programming has substantial value). That’s the sort of thing you won’t learn how to do reliably in any way beyond years of actually seeing and dealing with them, which is the sort of experience that *does* matter and brings the value to match.",seaswe,Experienced,False,t3_8grppp,t3_8grppp,1525416792.0,8,05-04-2018,0.9834,13.0,22.0,0.2811,"young, people, well, want, new, hire, experience, work, grad, good"

I am an east-indian immigrant on H1-B work-visa in the US, relocated pursuing a better career as a software programmer, as compared to my native country. I completed under-graduation in India about two decades ago from one of the best premier engineering and technology colleges. I have worked for 15 years in the US, all through as an hourly-pay contractor / consultant, out of which, over 11 years including currently as an Android apps developer. I am still awaiting my Green Card at this moment, which I hope will allow me to find employment slightly more easier that on my current work-visa status.

Ageism is real. And so is hierarchy. Given I've worked as a contractor / consultant, despite my years of experience, expertise, competency, and my personal effort in my personal time to stay up-to-date with the latest tech-trends and all, ageism is very much real. I know from my own experience that I am better than a few Staff Software Engineers that I had reported to in the very recent past 3 years. Even as a contractor, about 6 years ago, I have had the opportunity to lead teams and engineers, in the capacity and responsibility of a staff engineer but as a contractor I don't get the title, so I have been there, seen that. Nevertheless, I quit my last gig, without another gig already confirmed, just the day before Thanksgiving, because I got extremely triggered that I was being treated like a punching-bag by the staff engineer and the manager I was reporting to in a high-stress pressure-cooker work environment particularly this holiday-season at an e-comm giant. 

Few life-lessons that I can share - 

1. You are the CEO of your career. PERIOD!! If you have the slightest hint you are wasting time, switch-gears immediately.
2. Everything in life is a gamble. It's essentially a hit-or-miss!! So is with career!
3. You can never get comfortable / complacent about your career. I made that mistake once. Entire android dev community was quickly riding on RxJava high-tide, and I ignored learning it in my own personal time. Took me 3 years to recover, fortunately Kotlin-Flow and Android-Jetpack more-or-less have replaced RxJava almost entirely. 
4. Life happens, but never ever ever take your focus off your career.
5. Learn to never take work-stress. Teach the team to stop taking work-stress. Engineering and Technology related Work is meant to be fun, irrespective what Management and Product teams demand. 
6. Primary cause of all stress is ghost-incompetencies. Incompetency that's like Schrodinger's cat - it may or may not be there, it's entirely a perception problem. 
7. Never ever ever get angry / irritated / frustrated / triggered regarding work. 
8.

There's a constant barrage of new languages but there's a couple core languages which seem to have staying power, specifically I have in mind: Java and C/C++. While there are many new languages being developed much of the functionality can be emulated in these, and other, 'core' languages through frameworks.

Also language change doesn't happen over night, you'll have time to learn any new language which truly explodes while on the job. And businesses rarely drop their legacy projects for the latest new thing.

Finally once you've got a handle on the concepts of programming, OO, functional, procedural, data structures, new languages come much easier since the changes are largely connected to the syntax of a language.

Hope my wall of text helps.

TLDR; Change doesn't happen over night and understanding core concepts makes adopting new languages much less painful.

The things you really need to understand are that a) new languages are often based on existing languages b) new languages are far easier to pick up then you imagine and c) there are many, many software design concepts that extend beyond *all languages*.

Your story sounds a lot like mine. I went to high school right after the dot-com bubble. I loved programming but my family was convinced there was no future in it. My dad would tell me that when he was my age, everyone studied drafting (on paper), which ended up being a completely useless skill (I suppose because of CAD.... ironically enough I did this at one point) and all those people studying it were ruining their lives. Somehow this was supposed to be analogous to computer science and he really didn't want me studying it.

I decided to do the closest thing instead and I doubled in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I found the material very interesting, but I never lost the passion for programming. I tried a co-op in substation engineering, but I knew I couldn't do it for 40 years. By the time I graduated I just decided to do programming anyway. My lack of CS degree bit me. I tried to get into development, but got stuck in testing job for a while and couldn't get out. I eventually got into development, but it wasn't as easy as I expected.

My advice is to do what you love. No one can predict where an industry is going in several decades.

894,894,12,cscareerquestions,Does Software Development really require relearning new languages every few years? Ageism?,c50fvlu,"I wouldnt say re-learning a new language every few years is accurate. With a few exceptions most of what everyone is raving about today is 10 years old or older (Java, Haskell, Lisp, Scheme, C, C++, etc) Industry moves slow when it comes to new technologies such as new languages. So you'll see that on the horizon and pick things up even if you dont put real effort into learning right away.

Something that should be corrected right here though - School is NEVER a place to learn ANYTHING to fluency. Your standard CS program will have a small sprinkling of introductory courses in programming usually with different languages throughout.  So don't ever count on learning anything to fluency in an undergrad curriculum. It just wont happen.

That being said; learning a new language really is just learning syntax. Having learned C back in the 90's and PHP in the early 2000's and later Java, picking up Python took about 2 weeks. I learned PowerShell in about a week. C# took a little while about 3-4 weeks, only because of learning interfaces and libraries. The syntax was really down in a few hours. I'm re-learning C since I've never done anything with it in a while and I'm finding that C is very easy to pickup and understand only 2 weeks into learning. 

Proficiency or ""fluency"" is just honed skill or practice. And as you'll learn once you get out of college, you'll be introduced to things on virtually every project that you've never seen before, so each project you'll be learning something new.

895,895,12,cscareerquestions,Does Software Development really require relearning new languages every few years? Ageism?,c50g8zw,"New languages don't come along _that_ often.  And paradigms (i.e. ways of thinking about programming) come along even less.  So it's not _that_ bad.  But if you also include language improvements / new libraries / new frameworks - then yes it's a lot.  But really, you don't need to know everything, just enough to get the job done in a competitive way.  

The important thing though, is that the new stuff is driven by experienced guys spotting an opportunity to get the job done faster / cheaper / with less hassle / with more robustness.  If no release had ever been an improvement we'd all still be churning out some language from the late 60's.

But my point is that after 5 - 7 years you'll be on your way to _being_ _one_ _of_ _those_ _guys_.  New stuff won't be a chore - you'll spot that it means a happier client, and more solid project, better returns.  If you stay junior, then sure, some day someone's gonna dump a big book on your desk and say ""next project's in -blah-, learn it!"".  But if you're as passionate as you say, you'll honestly be the guy saying ""hey! let's use this - it's better"".  Or, maybe crucially, you'll be the guy who can have the insight to say ""no, we don't need -blah-, it's a fad; job's easier to do in C++ / PHP, whatever we're currently using"".

941,941,14,cscareerquestions,Is there ageism in tech industry?,g9fc3fy,"It depends. I’m 45 by the way. 

For context, I stayed at one company way too long and was very much an “expert beginner” in 2008. I knew how to code, but not modern software development practices. 

What I found over the past 12 years

2008-2012 - I was being asked language techno trivia and stuff like “what design patterns have you used”. I was also forced to prove that I could code. 

2014 - still being asked language techno trivia, how would I model a database and write queries. But, by the time, I’m also being asked process and software delivery questions about testing and deployment strategies and soft skill questions. 

2016 - present. For my last three jobs, the interview process was completely based on past projects, how would I solve their real world issues  and behavioral. I haven’t had to prove I could code since 2015. I haven’t been asked a single language techno trivia question or ask to do any even simple whiteboard coding since then. 

Most of my former coworkers who are still ICs are in the same boat. Even if they are developers, they seek out companies that want “adult supervision” or architect type roles. I can’t imagine being a 45 year old still forced to prove myself by “grinding Leetcode”. I don’t see many older developers applying for or getting jobs that require it or getting a job as a junior developer. 

I specifically had a manager who was himself 55 and wrote code, played with Docker and data analytics in his free time tell us not to hire old people (our age) for front end development. That our design style sucked. 

On a side note, I’ve been preaching for years  that if  you’re an older developer with experience and that if all you have to offer a company is your ability to reverse a binary tree on the whiteboard, you’re doing it wrong.

In my last job I worked with a guy with what I'd consider a very impressive career - experience across SWE and PM, small and large companies, and a few depth of knowledge in JavaScript. He also had a first from an Oxbridge college, so it's not like he never had opportunities early in his career. He is also in his fifties, and his kid is a SWE.

He liked working in smaller companies, and his skill set lends itself well to these kind of companies. Sadly, he was made redundant, and the only companies that seem to want to take him on are larger companies, despite numerous interviews and apparently acing his interviews (which I can totally believe). The real kicker? He applied for the same job as his son (different last names too), and his son got the job while he didn't.

I think part of this is why there is advice to only list the past 5 years of experience on your resume (unless the position expects more).

Tech is growing fast, so there's a big demand for managers to manage all the junior engineers coming in. And the average level of emotional intelligence among tech people isn't terribly high. So if you're good with people, you're going to get lots of opportunities/pressure to switch into management.

If you want to be a manager, then this is great. You can make big bucks and it frankly isn't that difficult. So even if you aren't the greatest programmer, if your soft skills are good, you're organized, and you can hang on long enough to move onto the management track, then you're basically set for life. Each year you just add a few more people under you in the org chart, and that justifies a nice annual raise.

If you don't want to be a manager, then you will need to figure out how to avoid getting pulled into it, and you will need to find a job where you can continue to grow as a technical ""individual contributor"". At some companies, this basically isn't possible. All the senior tech roles (above senior swe) are also management roles. But at other companies there are roles for staff+ engineers who are ICs. But you need new skills as you move up. At these levels, it's not really about coding any more. It's about setting direction and designing systems.

1042,1042,16,cscareerquestions,How is it like getting older as a software developer?,h2ssoar,"Late 40s woman with a 20+ year career in tech.  Self taught, 3 major career shifts to stay relevant, senior dev, and I do not code ""for fun"".  I code for money.  I do enjoy the work and I wouldn't pick a different career path because the work is so interesting and intellectually challenging to me. But honestly, I'd rather just not do dev as a career path anymore.  This industry and its expectations are relentless and exhausting.

IMO, it depends on what you want out of your career and life path.  If you want to chase the FAANG path as a senior and/or the very high TC gigs, then you'll need to make sure you always make smart job choices that give you experience in the latest skillsets (switching every couple years), always push yourself to take on new and bigger projects, and be prepared to constantly learn and evolve.  NEVER get settled into a job for comfort.  There will always be someone smarter and better and has more recent experience in the latest tech than you.  The key to remaining relevant is to learn how to add value to the org, stay on top of what is new, and be prepared to work hard.  As you get older (and slower), this gets less palatable.  Especially, if the specialty you are in is evolving rapidly.

If you don't want to chase the FAANG route, there are still plenty of options that are slightly less draining.  I know plenty of senior/principle devs in their 50s+ at non-FAANG companies that are still very much actively coding full time.  Going into management is no longer a necessary path for devs for career progression, unless you want to go that route.  However, to stay relevant, they still have to take on leadership work:  platform/service/tooling architecture, setting best practices, management of projects from design to deploy, and mentoring devs earlier in their careers. Most importantly, they are all life long learners, just like for the FAANG path.  The difference between devs that age out of the industry and the devs that stay is the interest in learning the latest tech relevant to your specialty consistently.

A long term career in tech is a marathon, not a sprint.   I don't learn new tech outside of work.  Picking jobs that allowed me to gain those skills is enough and far more valuable than learning something outside of a professional environment.  By keeping on top of the current stacks/best practices, you'll be able to flex with the job market and always stay employed.  This approach has allow me to not only survive, but thrive, during the dot-com bubble, the great recession, and the pandemic.  My job prospects now are better, and I am more sought after, than I have ever been.

As far as the people in the industry...  well.  It's getting better.  I should know.  :)   But as you get older you'll work with fewer and fewer people that are at a similar age as you.  I'm the oldest person in my group by at least 10 years.  Honestly I don't think that's much of a negative though, because often when I mentor junior engineers, I learn as much from them as they learn from me.

One other thing that has helped me is that I have better than average soft skills for a dev.  Earlier in my career that didn't help me as much, because the junior/mid-level jobs were straight implementation work.  Now that I've moved to the senior/principle level work, those skills are much, much more important and valuable.

Lately I have felt some burnout - I used to be very ""gung-ho"" about coding and my career, but life is short, and I have other interests. My rule for working extra time is fueled by some combination of whether I value the reasons I am working late, and is it needed since I am in a leadership position.

I do hope I live a life, where I am able to at least partially retire, and am still physically capable of doing other things I like, such as exercising, reading, traveling, and more recently longboading. 

Age is just a number and there is no correct path.

When I am closer to retirement, or maybe at some point I will be bored or more burnt out on what I do. I often ponder maybe some sort of  partial retirement down the road - maybe consult, freelance, build my own software. Coding, development, having reasons to wake up in the morning and collaborate with other, it  does add value to my life.

I don't know if I ever want to 100% retire, but I do want to do move towards only working on things that excite me, and prioritize value to me beyond the monetary. I think work for me does add more value than just monetary, but at this point monetary is a larger motivation due to life goals, then it might (or might not) do down the road.

Age is just a number, balance your needs and wants as best for you - sounds like you're already doing a lot of that - and your wants and needs may ever be in flux, as we all change as individuals over time. My key perspective is that life is short. What makes us happy is often a complex equation of mental health, physical health, financial health, personal relationships, hobbies and more .. and the right balance of these things for ""optimal"" happiness likely changes over time. A career in software currently at least is generally a very fortunate one, which yields a lot of to ponder more heavily on our personal happiness quotas, than a lot of other folks even have the means too.

* Keep expenses low and invest in low cost index funds.  Research the FIRE movement.

* If you want to ditch glasses, get PRK, Lasik or similar as early as possible. When you get to be my age Presbyopia will force you get glasses for computer work. I'm still in denial.
* As a consultant you are slightly more protected from ageism than as an employee. The same people who want to the energy of youth for employees want the wisdom of experience for short term consultants.  That said, I haven't run into ageism yet \[that I know of\] and work with plenty of people older than me.  But, also get used to working with people younger than you.
* Everything in tech is cyclical.  So, expect that stuff you did 10+ years ago that was abandoned will come back into favor.  It will trumpeted as a brand new thing, and you'll scoff at the ignorance of the people calling it a new thing.
* I get greys in my beard, but not my hair yet.  If I shave I look youthful; if I let the beard grow out I look wise.  Being male rocks.  
* You can learn stuff from the young 'uns.  And most of them will realize they can learn stuff from you, and respect your experience.

Mainly slowed down and needed to make different considerations because I'm now married with a kid and a mortgage. I'm still open to some risk but likely not as much as I was even 5 years ago. I don't spend as much time learning new things, but I can find/make the time and would if needed.

I've hopped ten times since graduating in 2008 as the recession did me no favors, and my angry young man syndrome also cost me early in my career, but I'm in a much better spot now. Been with my current employer almost 3 years and overall still enjoy working for them, so I'll likely be here for at least a little while longer.

I think the main difference now is what I'd look for in that next hop. Current place has unlimited PTO (and it's not a trap, they handle it super well), just upped their parental leave to a whopping 12 weeks (beneficial as discussions of adding a second kid have been had), and at least before the pandemic they offered lunch every day, paid for our parking downtown, lots of nice perks. I also love how flexible they are, so if I wake up and I'm sick or someone in my house is sick and therefore I need to help out, I can just ping my team's channel with the details and that's that.

As such any future employer would likely need to be just as flexible because honestly, I'm not sure I could go back to having to accrue and request time off or having a limited number of sick days again. I'm not down to sacrifice as much for the company as I may have once been because that means sacrificing time with my family.

Regarding actually being a developer? It's pretty good. I like having lots of experience at lots of different places under my belt, and I try to avoid the whole, ""Get off my lawn,"" mentality. Many of them also face some of the same issues I had early in my career, so it's nice to be the one _giving_ advice instead of mainly _seeking_ advice.

In general I think it's all in what you make of it. I know folks who are now turning out to be just as crotchety as the older employees we hated when we were younger, and it kind of makes me sad. I don't wanna be that old dev people want to avoid because in my mind the good old days are gone and I'm just keeping my head down until I can retire. I have lots of stories and experiences to share and help guide people with. I've learned good ways and bad ways of handling things. I wish I had more stability early in my career, and dammit if I wanna help provide that to younger and/or less experienced developers. Maybe if I can help some of them avoid becoming the angry young person I was early in my career it'll be worth it.

That said, I also love my 5K resolution monitor because text is soooo much sharper and easier for me to read, and I keep the brightness lower so my eyes don't feel as burned out at the end of each day.

Keep learning. Continuous education is hard to keep up with while you are working, particularly as you start to get deeper into specialization.

Every few years you need to poke your head up out of whatever gopher hole you’ve been in and take a good look around. Spend some time learning new tech.

Keep a hobby project going at all times. Use it to learn new stuff and try out ideas. This is your outlet when your day job is lagging behind current trends.

Don’t get stuck in any particular way of thinking about technology. Allow yourself to evolve. Don’t dismiss the ideas of “those young folk” just because you think you walked 10 miles to your IDE in the snow, uphill both ways.

I've had a job working with computers and/or networking since I was 18; part time while working on my undergrad, and then full time since then.  (Bachelors in Physics, MS in EE)  I went from engineering into product management and marketing, back into software engineering, into management for a while, back into individual contributor.  I've started 3 companies, two of which are still in business, but I didn't make any real money from them beyond a meager salary.  I've never worked freelance/consulting, so YMMV.

I believe ageism exists, but I haven't seen it myself.

My advice would be save your money and try to retire or transition to a non-coding role by the time you are 45. But that may totally depend on what you enjoy.

It highly depends on the size of the company. Generally smaller companies don't want principal+ level engineers to be part of a single engineering team as they would be overpaid for their effort. Once you get beyond principal in to distinguished or fellow territory you are expected to be executing across the entire org even in larger companies.

If you want to remain part of an engineering team for your entire career nothing wrong with that but your options will narrow significantly on promotion opportunities. 


Which is entirely understandable as the risk of us being wrong to the company has much further reach then if we were part of a single team. The difficulty is mostly in interviewing, and depends on how good you are at talking about what you do/your process.

My current job I got via network and the interview was a chat mostly with people I already knew so not really an interview at all.

Also highly dependent on what kind of workload you are willing to accept/how much koolaid you are willing to drink.

I just don't know that my nest egg is quite big enough to actually retire right now, although going to part-time would be feasible and if I actually left my job I may even try to swing-trade the market full-time.  Definitely agree about jobs coming easily though.

I got laid off from my last job quite suddenly due to the company shutting down because reasons, and I signed an offer letter within a week of my last day at the old company (I really miss my old company too; it was a lot of fun and is quite possibly the job where I learned the most out of my entire career).  Lots of jobs out there and a shortage of good folks pretty much across the board, but especially for senior/lead positions.  In the past six years at least, it's ALWAYS been a struggle to even find good candidates and well over half the time I've lost them to other offers.

If you're good, at a senior/lead level (or higher) in terms of experience (quality of experience over quantity, but quantity is still useful), and have spent the time to develop a broad skillset and a strong reputation with a large professional network, then there are a lot of opportunities out there.  There can be some pretty fierce competition for roles at really good companies (after all, how many architects or tech directors does a single company really need?) but there are still a lot of other companies that are perfectly fine.  Everyone wants something slightly different too, so it's not a huge deal.

Hey. 

That's a lot of work! I think you have a pretty good plan to focus on your personal growth.

I wanted to add that I think we should try to do that during working hours, when we're paid. We should arrange this with our manager IF you think they're down for that.

Taking time every week to fix technical debt is very similar thought process.

Make flexible time every week to learn something has also made me very happy in my learning process.

Similarly, at your current job, breaking into a new technical skillset will help with growth. Talk to your manager about that as a long term goal. Eventually you can find something.


Maybe there's some build up time for you though, since you're out of practice...

I found it took about 45 minutes, 4 days a week, over about 3 weeks the first time, and I was good to go. In between, I'd think about the problems I didn't solve in the time boxed session, so then I'd try to solve it the next time in another time boxed session. There must have been some more time I spent in between sessions too.

I'm an older developer (20+ years). When I was new to the field and worked primarily in startups, I had no problem job-hopping every year or two because the reward of higher pay outweighed the risk of temporary unemployment if a company didn't work out.

Then I acquired children, a mortgage, multiple college funds, and the need to have a predictable long-term schedule for planning family events. That shifted the equation. The monetary rewards of job-hopping no longer outweighed the risk it presented to the stability and financial needs of my family. Increasing pay was no longer the driving factor in my employment decisions. Even today, I regularly pass on higher-paying positions because of the impact they'll have on my free time and family. I make more than enough money to live the lifestyle I want, so why would I sacrifice that lifestyle to make even more money?

My coding background:  I am completing a bachelor's in Comp Sci (class of '23) and have also done a lot of self learning. 

I was extremely fortunate to get a job with a multi national company that had a local office.  I never planned on working at a FAANG due to the competition level to get in and the fact I had 0 desire to work a billion hours a week. 

My advice is aim for ""boring"" companies like insurance, banking, something in your old industry, etc because the bar to entry is somewhat lower. The pay won't be what you read about (eg. YouTuber swears they made 200k right out of bootcamp) but it's a foot in the door.  Once you have experience, you'll have leverage to either move up at the first job or get a different/better job. 

At 55 it also depends on your retirement horizon.  If you want to peace out at 65, depending on how long and how vested your retirement plan is at the current job,  you might want to tough it out these last few years.  A lot depends on your finances and your retirement time-line.

Finally it depends on your level of coding experience. A good bootcamp with a solid track record of job placement can help.  

Otherwise, if you're self taught you'll be competing with college grads where the presence of a degree is a gatekeeper and bootcamp grads who are at least guaranteed an interview with sponsor companies.

I was asked by someone if I had ever experienced ageism, which caught me off guard a bit.  There were a couple of people about your age in my bootcamp who are working now (although one of them had IT experience already).  It is not impossible by any means.  Some companies will look more favorably on having extensive experience than others (non-tech companies like banks and insurance would be the most likely).  The hardest part is getting the first job.  Most developers don't seem to stay at a job for more than a few years anyway, so companies don't really hire for ""will this person be here for the next 30 years"" like they theoretically used to.

All that being said, I  don't want to downplay the difficulty.  I just switched from a completely unrelated field in academia and got a raise that was more than the cost of the bootcamp, so it was worth it for me.

They started coding from a young age. They follow tech news. They build hobby projects in their free time. All their friends are also engineers. 

This is the root of the negative comments you are experiencing, not your age or gender. If you came in saying that you've always enjoyed tinkering with tech and programming little hobby projects and now you want to make it a career, people would be more positive. 

This is a career just like any other though. It doesn't have to be your entire life as long as you spend a reasonable amount of time to become skilled and capable. 

You can pick it up now and get a job. You just need to target your learning efforts to in demand skills and think about how to demonstrate your skills in interviews. 

Work on your story for why you want to transition into tech. For example, maybe you could focus on wanting a new challenge. You have had a good career in medicine, but now you are feeling stagnated and now you want to pursue a second career. Maybe you could say something about how long you imagine working. Like, instead of retiring, you would like to transition into a second career. Not everyone wants to stop working in their 60s.

I saw your comment about not wanting to work with people as much. It's a bit of a myth that software engineers work in isolation with their computers. Some teams are more isolated, but software engineering involves a lot of communication with other engineers and designers and product managers. There can be a lot of politics.

You’ll still be 58 in 3 years whether you study programming or not so there’s no downside. So I guess you can give it a try and see if it’s for you. The programming world is complex as there’s a lot to learn, entry level is extremely saturated, and tech changes really fast—but you already know that since you work in the medical field. 

I agree with other commenters though in that your age may be your biggest roadblock here. But if you’re already burned out at your current job then why not give programming a try? Worst that can happen is that in 6 or 8 months you realize that it’s frustrating, too hard or boring and you’ll give it up but at least you tried. But if you end up liking it and things seem to come fairly easy to you then you might have a whole new job and new adventure in 2 or 3 years :)

So beyond the blatant ageism at IBM, there aren’t reputable claims of it as an overall trend. CS Majors were barely a thing when I went to school at 2005. And the growth has been keeping up pretty steady overall, besides the demand for entry-level. 

So you won’t find many 40 year olds in the field for that reason. But the 40+ crowd are still really valuable to teams these days. My last shop worked with legacy code and they worked circles around me because of their experience with the other older frameworks, while I had to onboard and I never stopped learning new things from them. They are what senior developers should be and every team needs those. 

The second factor, is that in every industry there is a point where you get “pushed” into management. But it isn’t ageism. If you want to stock the grocery store for 15+ years you can. But at some point in your career you will be offered an opportunity for advancement that’s too good to pass up. 

In the military the promotions were kind of forced by structure and rank. So I didn’t know anybody that was a SSgt or above that worked with code at all. But I did know people who turned down the opportunity to promote who sounded just like you, because they didn’t want to enter management and loved actual work. 

There’s a scary idea that new guys are always going to be quicker and smarter than you, but if you don’t have enough knowledge and experience as a fresh college grad there’s something wrong. CS is one of the most toxic hiring industries in history, but it isn’t about age, it’s about maximizing efficiency and getting the best engineers on their team. In no way should a 22 year old from College be a better hire than someone employed in the industry for 15 years. That efficiency might pyramid up and push you to management roles so you can actually lead a team with your skill and expertise, but I’m sure you’d always be a good candidate and steal them from juniors and some senior devs depending on the age of the technology and relativity to your experience.

My advice: try management before you decide that you hate it. Try launching a small business on your own before you decide that it's not for you.

* The CTO of a company I worked for could not find a job after the company closed.  He is now working as a software QA tester.
* I worked with a temporary software engineer contractor who used to be a senior software engineering manager.
* A director of engineering for a company I used to work for could not get a job and who kept calling me asking for help in getting a job.  There is a happy ending in this case, he got funding for his own company for which he is the CEO.
* A Senior Vice President of a company that got demoted and now is an individual engineer.

It is quite possible some of your older software engineers you work with used to be senior management.  They will not admit it unless you know them very well.  What they all have in common is that they got too old.

CS is the only profession where people become too old for their job.  For example, you don't hear about MDs becoming too old and unemployed.  My MD is in his 70's and I would much rather see him than an MD in his 20's.  When was the last time you met a software engineer in his 70's?

My company recently did a round of layoffs, and 2 devs over the age of 50 we're let go, and another one in the same age group quit because he said he, ""saw the writing on the wall"".

The thing that convenietly gets left out when guys like this tell their story is that they haven't bothered to learn anything new in the past 20 years. One of the devs I mentioned was an old systems programmer who made it very clear that he wasn't willing to work in any language but C, and called object oriented languages ""too complicated"". These guys were all also paid at the principal/staff level, but their skills were all on the same level as a very average mid-level dev, and not a single one of them was willing to step up and do any kind of mentorship or tech lead type work, so essentially we had a bunch of extremely overpaid mid-level engineers who couldn't handle new tech and weren't even willing to pass on what knowledge  and wisdom they had to the juniors.

You have to keep your skills relevant, ***and improve every year*** bottom line. If you have 30 years of experience in this industry, companies ***will*** expect you to be a grandmaster greybeard level engineer, not an average run-of-the-mill mid-level.

Another way to look at it is this: If your industry advances at 4% a year, but you do nothing to improve yourself or learn new skills, then every year you fall behind by 4%. That compounds year after year until you're so far behind the curve, that it will take am absolute massive effort for you to catch up.

They get into software in Ruby's heyday and figure they'll just be Ruby masters someday and king of the hill then.

Just last year, me and my team did Android with imperative Java and data binding. Now this year, we are completely transitioned to Kotlin, FRP, and MVI. As the principal engineer, not only did I have to completely transition to a totally new language and to a new paradigm, but it was on me to get 6 other Android devs there too, especially since it was my decision to do it. This year has been extreme, in this regard; however, running this treadmill is, itself, an entire skill. There are strategies and tactics and people skills you need just to hone the *skill of keeping up*. Seniors and principals have to to learn this. So many people underestimate it, be one overly attached to their platforms or languages and never advance to a senior position, or worse, get left behind and leave the industry.

Flavors of developer I have been over the years, in order:

* HTML back before CSS
* Lotus Notes
* ASP / VBS
* ASP.Net + C#
* LAMP / PHP
* Android
* iOS
* Unity
* Android again
* Android + Kotlin + Rx

At each phase, I was wholly a X developer. For instance, I followed Lotus Notes industry news and took Lotus Notes classes. At first, each platform boosted my career, but any one if them could have dragged me down into obscurity if I didn't jump ship. Not only do I not expect to stop changing platforms, I have an entire slice of my energies devoted just to the concern of changing platforms.

I completely expect to leave Android someday or that Android might look so different that it would be a different platform. I have some predictions already about what it will be.

1. New hires come in with a completely different set of skills they expect to use, and are disappointed when they can't, so we work behind the scenes to try to accommodate. My example: Use of JavaScript to implement logic in a C++ heavy product. Also, C++11/14/17 in a product that was originally coded by C developers and was very only recently adapted to allow C++ exceptions.

2. Senior developers spend an increasing amount of time in meetings, design and code reviews, and answering emails, even when they aren't managers. 

3. Senior developers estimate things more accurately. That widget that an intern prototyped in a week and a junior developer estimated would take three weeks to ""make real"", is actually a several-month project to scale to all gmail.com users.

Incompetent management looks at commit history and see those developers aren't committing much code and therefore must not be contributing.

There is a work-life balance tradeoff that we pretend is the same for everybody, but negatively impacts people who have a family, or have been in the workforce for 15-20 years and is unwilling to work unreasonable hours.

This is just blatantly false. It's not a myth and it definitely exists. 

Just because you and your colleagues have not experienced it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. This is like saying I personally don't suffer from hunger and none of my friends do either, so starvation must not exist.

After reflecting on it just now, I guess it's a self-taught thing that I'm alright at doing. Maybe I need to organize the skill into a discipline. I'm going to look for books on it, and maybe consider presenting the topic to my local Android meetup.

I can give a breakdown of the hardest of these planned escapes of mine, which might be helpful:

I remember a time when being a PHP developer was new and hot. But, after years of LAMP stack development, and following the industry, I had been taking very seriously that, for years, places like reddit had been making fun of PHP more than praising it, and other technologies like Ruby was getting all the buzz (this was in 2007-ish). So, I started saving money for my move. I considered the new technologies out there, and by 2008, for a number of reasons, I chose Android: it was new, I thought its open-ness would cause it to overtake iOS, and the tech stack was something I thought I would enjoy. I took my chuck of money, quit my PHP job, rented every room in my house, and holed myself up for months making a [video game](https://imgur.com/a/ns1EG) in the very early Android SDK. While still making it, I had my feelers out there, and eventually snapped up an Android position with similar pay to my previous position. I had the advantage of being able to bring a pretty decent prototype to interviews in a technology that was so new that most developers had either never released anything on it, or had only one released product. Most companies interviewing me had never released an Android app. From my demo, it was obvious I could make the thing they were asking. After a few career jumps, I quickly became one of the developers in highest demand because I got to be there from the start.

That was my most difficult transition. It was also my most ambitious, because it was a total transition. There were not very many similarities between Android development and LAMP development. Most of the time, these transitions are more organic: one technology leads to the next. In this circumstance, I wanted to leave web development completely.

While that example was pretty extreme, it doesn't have to be. You can avoid extreme transitions if you navigate your career with foresight. You have to captain your ship and avoid dead ends. Keep your eyes on the industry and *be honest with what you see*. If, like with PHP, you see that it's getting nothing but disrespect, don't fool yourself into being nostalgic for the days when it used to be the hot shit. If employers are not hiring the kind of developer you are anymore, then don't be one of those. Make your moves in measured steps so that you don't have to make them in painful dramatic steps. For instance, I work at a big company these days. Bit companies are risk averse. It would be the easy path to just keep the Android developers using Java. But, when every industry talk is using Kotlin for examples, that would be dishonest of me to do, and it would be shirking my responsibilities not to take the measured step of upgrading all the Android devs into Kotlin devs. We moved to Kotlin last year, so that we don't have to have a worse transition later. This year, we have an amount of time and energy focused on trying out Flutter and React Native to find out of they're also threats to the way we do things. If Flutter is really the next hot shit, then we'll do Flutter. I wont even consider the previous Kotlin transition a wasted effort. It, at the very least, cultivates a culture here of *keeping up* and *paying attention* and being excited about the present.",ColdSnickersBar,Principal Software Engineer,False,t3_9480cg,t1_e3jg8cq,1533315258.0,21,08-03-2018,0.9029,-3.0,0.0,0.3132,"thing, learn, new, get, know, use, year, make, code, stuff"

Because it's not what we're discussing. Our conversation isn't about the work and analysis that went into this specific decision, just that transitions are important in an industry that requires that you, your team, your product, and your company, keep up with the times. I was giving an example, not explaining my rationale.

Also, keep in mind that I didn't say we had to modify code to do this. There was another reply floating around here that imagined that I said we ""rebuilt"" our whole product suite, when I didn't say anything like that.

As for platforms and languages: whenever I hear people bickering about the platforms to which they've devoted themselves, I can't help but to feel like they've been manipulated.

While things like PhoneGap and React Native didn't kill Android development, if something *like* those ever makes apps at least 80% as good as Android apps, then that will be the end of my time in Android development. If the wealth of web developers out there can make mobile apps too, then companies will stop hiring Android devs. Existing Android devs will sabotage the effort as much as they can, but they'll only slow the inevitable. This can come from the development of a new framework, the maturing of React Native as a framework, or even from some new compatibility SDK or improvement to Android that allows web views to work better. I real possible future for mobile is that their app platform becomes some kind of large web browser platform. If this happens, there will be resistance from Android devs, but instead of crying about it, I'll be learning Typescript.

Google seems to be pitting Flutter development against some pretty awesome improvements to the Android SDK, and seeing which comes out ahead.

It would be one thing if you're talking about these transitions from an academic stand point where you're measuring some performance benefits or some other measure.  But that's not what you're doing, unless I'm completely misunderstanding.

Therefore discussing the value of such transitions to a business seems to be absolutely relevant to the discussion.

- leaving formal employment to become advisors / coaches / consultants / content creators (books, newsletters, podcasts etc) / board members

- investing & philanthropy (if they’re monetarily successful or can raise capital)

At that, I've seen some devs get themselves even pushed out of straight-up backend stuff because they haven't kept up to date with changes in C# and Java and the like so that they only work with stuff that has not had major changes for several decades.

There is I am sure ageism as well - I had a jackass at a former job who'd bring up my age whenever we had a disagreement - but IMO a much bigger issue is that need to constantly stay on top of tech that can sometimes not be so easy to do when you have a pretty well-worn pathway to just keep doing the things you've always been doing (especially when newer tech - I think of NoSQL solutions in particular but there are I'm sure countless examples among frontend frameworks as well - is in many ways not as robust as the old way of doing things).

How old are you, /u/Oso?

I'm 72. When I passed through college there was  no such thing as computer science. There were only two programming courses at the University of Michigan, both FORTRAN in the engineering department. I learned FORTRAN in high school in 1967. I went to grad school in an unrelated field and started coding professionally in 1981. FORTRAN of course.

I retired at 65. It was really a struggle, finding and keeping work, the last 10 years. I probably worked about 50-60% of the time in my late 50s, 30% of the time in my 60s. 

Part of my problem was *being old*.

To get interviews, I took off the things on my resume that identified my age, such as when I graduated college. It was very discouraging when I would sail through a phone interview, show up for the in-person interview, then see the immediate look of disappointment followed by eyes-glazed-over when the interviewers saw how old I was. The hiring managers were generally in their 30s -- *half* my age. I look young for my age, but not young enough.

Another part of the problem was my difficulty keeping up with the technology. I started learning the Microsoft stack when I was 54. It mutated constantly. Last year's hot tech was obsolete a couple years later. That discouraged me. There was so MUCH of it. Knowing a programming language well used to suffice. Before moving to Microsoft, I made my living for 18 years because I was good with a particular IDE/language and had decent SQL skills. Contrast those *two things* with the modern world, where there are 20 or 30 technologies that developers are supposed to know. The mix is constantly changing. I got pretty good at jQuery, but then Angular was the cool thing, then *Angular* mutated, and then it was superseded by a half-dozen other things. I did not learn as well as I had when I was younger. I was discouraged and cynical. I couldn't keep up with the treadmill.


No offense, but: LOL.

How many times have you successfully brought a lawsuit for age discrimination, /u/Oso? Let me guess: >!zero!<.

A lawsuit might work if the CEO sends you an email:


Of course, emails like that never happen. Companies are very wary of being sued. That is one of HR's main functions.

My last real (non-contract) job, I was about 60. When I started, the company was in a growth phase: they hired 6 developers at once bringing the complement to about 35. A year later, one of the company's cash cows unexpectedly terminated their contract. Two weeks after that 10 of us were laid off. ***The 10 who lost their jobs were the 8 oldest people in the department, plus a couple 20-somethings.*** Everyone guessed that the latter were included so the former couldn't sue for age discrimination. I explained what happened to two different labor law attorneys. They both told me that the case wouldn't go anywhere.

The industry is still relatively new compared to other industries, it has continually grown, and continuous to grow, to swallow other industries (every industry has a tech counter part: edutech, medtech, sextech, etc with industries disrupted by technology)… so more people entering the industry today than 20 years ago might make it a slightly younger industry on average or median… however this doesn’t mean there are no positions for people over 50.

And at that, if you really, really wanted to stick with JS becuase you're masochistic or something, there's always Node.

If they do database work, well... even better! I'm of the opinion that it's good to learn new tech, and by ""new"" I mean new to you moreso than new to the industry. If for instance your backend is still supported by SQL, it's probably a good thing to go out and learn it so you can be that guy.

The 'for some reason' is that it's still a relatively young field. Apple was founded 40 years ago. The number of people aged 50+ that are developers are just not likely to be found because of how new the field is. You have to also factor in that our parents did not grow up with technology and there is a learning curve associated with it if you didn't grow up with it.

PHP is only 21 years old. JS is only 21 years old. There are older languages, but just think for a second how booming software development has been in the recent last two decades vs 40 years ago.

So that explains one part of the reason we don't have a large % of elder programmers (funnel issue, still new field, technology gap for older people when it first came out). The second is burn out. How many technical managers did you have that were above 40? I see elder PMs in companies I've been in where people transitioned from being programmers to management.

If you look just a little into *why* these numbers exist, you'll easily see the worries are largely unfounded and things are easily explained. Just saying 'Well, I don't see many people 40+' doesn't mean you should jump to the conclusion 'I don't have job security past 40' or 'I will be discriminated because of my age'.

I work with a mix of both young-ish and older devs (I'd say half and half, but I'm just giving one pov), and I've learned a LOT from them. They exist, and they're generally very efficient with their time and fun to have lunch with! One of my mentors is in his 70s. He already has a couple houses, and works 3 days a week, but he loves his job, so he said he would retire a couple years ago, but hasn't. And they absolutely need him, and his card just says ""Software engineer"", and what he works on is highly complex and requires \*deep\* knowledge.

What the other poster said is correct. Culture is also really important. These older devs don't necessarily care for the perks of the job and will tend to work in places that are a lot less about frills and just pay you to do the work, because they have families and lives and houses and gardens to take care of. However, these may not necessarily align (in terms of the younger generation) with the kinds of jobs the large group aims for. Quite frankly, my 70 year old mentor is \*not\* impressed with SV; he'd prefer to hang out at the Computer History Museum and work on that stuff, or his personal projects; he has lots of peers who worked at top companies for several years and don't want to be a part of \*hip company\*, even though they are all recruited \*constantly\* (looking through the lens of the birth of computers, how problems were solved is fascinating, so I'm starting to believe him and try to stop by Computer History Museums often).

I would \*definitely\* try to find and befriend one of these unicorns; they have SO much knowledge, and they can tell you about cycles in the software industry, which is important to know as a younger person navigating through a career.

Like other folks have said, there's no singular truth. Age isn't the sole factor in determining to hire someone. If it is, you don't want to work at that company. There are plenty of older (40-50) engineers at companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook. They can keep up just fine.

But can everyone do that? No, everyone has different natural talents and everyone ages differently. I know people who are 40 and have a very hard time picking up new stuff because they gradually lost interest over the years. And I know people who are 50 who love playing around with new stacks.


It's totally possible that by the time you're 40 you'll be bored with it. There's no way to tell. Life happens.

Also keep in mind that many people who start out programming find themselves gravitating towards more people-oriented roles later in their career, like management or project/product management or even sales. It's not necessarily because they don't understand tech, it's because they'd rather use their experience to affect projects at a higher level.

Hence the whole ""young people are smarter"". Nevermind experience, knowledge of a variety of systems/languages/frameworks, etc. All of that doesnt matter. That you couldnt solve some academic question in 20 minutes on the spot as well as the kid that just graduated makes it so that you just dont know how to code.

Make no mistake, software engineering, 20 years later is much harder to land jobs too because there are a LOT more people that know how to write code.. or at least they pass leetcode style interviews. I have absolutely had the unfortunate displeasure of being part of an interview team where I indicated the candidate lacked any sort of ""team"" spirit, if you will, and while they did pass a white board test, they seemed rather poor at communication in one way or another. They got hired, the person who had a great personality, did well overall but not as well on the whiteboard bit did not, and a month in, it was clear the candidate (this happened twice to me) did not know how to code jack shit, had no ability to really learn.. but because their had an amazing college degree and could do leetcode.. they got hired. It is really sad when you have managers who value your ability to do something that has nothing to do with the day to day job, over experienced people who can figure shit out themselves and be a lot of value to the team. But that is largely what you will find in SV and FANNG style companies (or those trying to mimic them).

1968,1968,24,cscareerquestions,Worried about future,ekbwlif,"I don’t think there is any one answer here. I think part of it is as time goes on, the really great engineers make a killing and eventually hit a point where they can retire early and do their own thing, which often means occasional consulting or remote work. And as time goes on the bad engineers simply hit a ceiling and it becomes clear they can’t do the job, and so they either self remove or get put on action plans and eventually get out. I think there’s also a lot of validity to the thought that as people start families they tend to move out of bigger cities and try to find work life balance at companies that offer it. 

My gut feeling is that in general Silicon Valley has more issues than other places.  That’s bound to happen when you are based around a culture of rule breaking and excess; when most of the business leaders don’t have enough experience to be leading the companies they are. That doesn’t mean that all companies there do, and certainly not nation wide, but if you’re there in the bubble it could be part of what you are seeing. It’s also a very real phenomenon that those jobs attract college grads and in many cases repel senior engineers. The big salaries, free food, and other amenities aren’t always what they are cracked up to be... the intent of all of it is to lure you in and keep you at your desk as many hours as possible. Many burn out after a few years and switch careers entirely. 

There are lots and lots of jobs out there throughout the entire country for SWEs of all experience levels. There is so much software work materializing that the truth is there simply aren’t enough skilled/smart senior engineers to go around. All of us are fighting for them. Just stay relevant and you’ll be fine. 

If you hit your 40s and decide you want to try something different, there is management and executive leadership. I think the stories you hear about folks hating their job or not being able to find work are exaggerated. The truth is it’s a lot like being a senior SWE in that you have to be really good at your job to succeed because of all the increased visibility. A lot of SWEs are not people-persons or can’t get out of their own head and end up failing as a manager. Good managers are always sought after and in high demand, just like good senior SWEs. 

Finally, remember that in the US anyone over age 40 is a protected discrimination class. Although not a complete solution, it does motivate companies to put processes in place to thwart outright discrimination, and anyone who believes they are a victim does have a potential legal remedy. I’m not naive, I know there are probably companies out there that don’t care.

You're working in frontend, which does tend to have a more junior workforce. Front end skills from 10 years ago are pretty much useless now. And I think this trend will continue. This means if you have more than a few years of experience in that area, you may find there is a pay cap that is lower than other areas that have longer cycles. Many front end engineers sometimes move into those areas.  


Finally, the fact that there are not that many people in there 40's and 50's in this industry. Firstly, tech was a lot smaller of an industry 20-30 years ago. And 17 years ago, a lot of people left the industry and never returned. Quite a lot of the people who did stay, have made a lot of money over the decade or so following. If you were 50 and you had $5m, would you want to keep working or spend time with family and travel?

I work with some engineers in their 50s, and they're all extremely talented engineers who have been in the software engineering game for 25+ years. Most of them were hired within the past few years, and their ability to pick up new technologies quickly is remarkable.

That being said, right before the economy crash in 2008, my dad got laid off from his job as a Software Engineer. He was almost 70 years old at that point, had been at this company for a good few years, had decades of experience, and had no problem picking up new technologies. The company was just struggling and ended up laying off much of their workforce, and they're still struggling to this day from what I hear. 

Anyway, he has a PhD in Mathematical Physics and an MS in Computer Science. He had trouble finding any job after he got laid off because some younger hiring managers tend to be intimidated by older applicants because they're worried that the applicant won't work well under somebody who's 40 years younger than them. Additionally, they expected an older super experienced engineer to expect a much higher starting salary than a 22-year old college graduate who's just looking to get a job to pay off his student loans. That wasn't the case for my dad as he wasn't looking for some insane salary. But from a hiring manager's perspective, it was easier to higher a young engineer who wouldn't try to negotiate up on salary and would just write code without asking questions, instead of an experienced engineer who might want much more money and who might try to ""shake things up"" and try to constructively change the way the company did things based on their many years of experience as an engineer. Some companies welcome constructive change, and some don't.

Of course, not all companies are like this, and I firmly believe that if he were looking for a job today, he'd have no trouble finding one. I know the two most recent companies I've worked at love hiring older experienced engineers based on what they bring to the table, and they have no problem paying that older engineer an extra $40,000/year over the younger engineer because those extra decades of experience are valuable and important.

I know what the more tenured engineers at my current job start at salary-wise, and it's around $40,000/year more than what I make (and they hired me at the higher range of starting salaries for new engineers with my level of experience.) They pay us all well, but they value that extra experience in the older engineers and I totally agree that those more experienced tenured engineers deserve that higher salary.

The thing which makes a person unhirable after a LOT of CS experience, is they let themselves stagnate and be good at doing the same thing over and over.  Our field does change, so you do have to continuously learn to stay relevant.  However, you absolutely can keep your skills relevant in this field without spending any time outside of work on CS.  To do that, you will have to (a) pursue learning opportunities and challenging work at work (b) leave jobs that are causing stagnation and (c) carefully choose jobs that keep your skills relevant.

&#x200B;

Generally speaking, most of the actual studies on the topic show that

* Ageism is a measurable thing in general, and also specifically the software industry
* Older developers self-report worrying about ageism or self-report that they have been discriminated against due to age

&#x200B;

Beyond that, it'll just be people arguing or expressing personal anecdotes as universal fact.  I've personally witnessed age discrimination.  I've also personally worked with a guy who turned 70 and he was a really good developer.

&#x200B;

There aren't many other fields that have the same ROI/earning potential as software/tech and are likely to have similar levels of ageism.

&#x200B;

Personally, I don't think this is a reason to abandon a career in software.  It's a reason to be aware of the situation and to take appropriate steps to minimize your risk.  As you age, the perception is going to be that you...

* Don't keep up with new technology
* Don't care as much about your job
* Aren't willing to change your habits/take direction
* Are slower, less intelligent
* etc...

&#x200B;

The best way to fight that perception is to *display* that those things aren't true.

&#x200B;

Finally - the number of software/it related positions has been increasing at pretty rapid rate and I'd imagine most of the people joining the industry are young.  

According to this, we had \~612,000 software engineers  in the US [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software\_engineering\_demographics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering_demographics)

Things I've seen:  
- Hr and Recruiters obsession with shiny buzzwords.

They figure if they can't find someone with the experience already might as well hire someone younger and cheaper right?  
- It's easy to get pidgeonholed into a situation where say, the entire app is written in vb6, which is a dead end for your career, but it doesn't make any sense for the business to rewrite the whole app in a newer trendier language either, leaving you with a dead career if you ever get let go.  
- Software managers are very insecure and I've seen plenty of times where it's an issue for them to be working with someone their same age because of some sort of ego/competition thing. They can handle people younger than them but not their same age or older.  
- There's often not a ton of opportunity to learn or practice social skills in software, but the older you get the more you're expected to have them.  
- Expectations: I've seen a lot of absurd expectations from bosses who have no idea what to expect from a ""senior developer"". One boss insisted I should know the git repo address and database password on a new project because I was a ""senior developer"".  
- Physical Issues: A couple of decades of sitting, particularly in the cheapest and crappiest chairs the company could find, start to lock your body up in weird ways. Your eyes start to get worse at looking at a screen, often computer glasses fix this, but not always.  
- The older people who know the current system can see giving info to younger people as ""helping"" whereas they see people their same age or older as ""competition"". In one particular case I found that the senior devs would begrudginly share info with younger developers but would lock me (the same age) out of getting info from them.  
- As you get older you do have less energy for dealing with bullshit. What happens in older professions the experience you gain lets you avoid bullshit. But a lot of times trying to avoid going down a bad path in dev triggers your boss's control issues instead and you can't do anything about it. Like look at agile's obsession with reassigning every task randomly and specifically not to the dev who worked on it.  
- There is a definite risk of burnout as your manager tries to push you into doing more and more work as time goes on. I've seen several not-young people pushed into burnout then fired.  

A lot of times it comes down to that when you're younger and you can't do something it can be explained away by your age, when your older you face a lot of the same unsolvable issues (no documentation, info that left when the last guy left, etc) but now you're supposed to magically know the answer.

* They refuse to learn new things from younger people. They only accept stuff coming from old gurus. At least Uncle Bob is considered one by most of them, but it doesn't mean they follow most of his guidelines.

* When losing a technical argument they will pull out their 20 inches dick of experience on the table, often referencing a bad situation they had years ago without any additional context or relevant information about how this would be relevant in this particular situation, more than 10 years later.

* They consider themselves specialists of the useless complexity they create and instead of taking the time to do things right, it's we instead that must learn from their wisdom.

* They will consider themselves the watchdogs of some parts of the code and most of the time attempting to add a need behaviour or fixing bugs usually turns into a morale draining adventure that is only done when absolutely necessary. Otherwise the rest of the programmers will find less elegant ways to code their features just to avoid modifying those parts of the code, this is usually done by abusing the decorator design pattern.

* They usually take way too much place during meetings because they have a comment for everything everyone says. They are a huge pain during DSMs.

Your interview process is weeding out the dumb people, and ostensibly forces a lower limit on technical and mental ability. So if you were to get a young person and an older person and find that they had the same mental abilities, in all likelihood the older person, were they the same age as the younger person, would be far more capable. In addition, when you get an older person you get the benefit of age and maturity. They're more likely to understand the value of cooperation and teamwork, of turning the other cheek, they'll likely be better able to navigate and resolve conflicts, they'll likely be more comfortable with themselves and, quite frankly, they're more likely to realize how fucking lucky they are to be working in this field right now (I know I am)!

I work with a dev that codes exclusively in VB and .NET webforms. He has been in his position for 18 years and is now in his mid 50s. If we were to go under today, he would either need to find another legacy codebase to work on (hint: he definitely would) or learn some new tech.

If he wanted to, he would quickly pick up new tech. I am sure he has had to reinvent himself before and could do it again. With experience, it is easier to pick up new concepts.

Salaries start at about $60k fresh out of college and senior dev/architect salaries cap out somewhere around $150k, though some companies may top out lower than that.  Bonuses might take the total comp above that mark.

If you put a lot into your career and are willing to move between different companies every couple years if necessary, it's possible to advance to senior dev and hit the $100k mark after several years.

Cost of living is cheap.  I could get a great house in a great neighborhood for $200-300k.  And cheaper houses in cheaper but still decent neighborhoods are available for $75k-150k.

But I've also never been fixated on graduating from a top-tier college and working for a FAANG company.  Considered it from time to time, yes.

Or my advice, don't target startup companies, but try to target larger organizations where the median age is like 30 - 40, thus a more mature environment.  If you have programming experience you could try to target development positions, but in reality if you're coming from an environmental chemist background as your former career, your best bet might be to try to get into QA and Automation (testing developers' code, uncovering and reporting defects, and using programming languages to automate the tests).

As for age discrimination fears, I can tell you in my last gig, the white-haired ""old guy"" with 6 kids was actually the most senior, intelligent, and valued member of the team, surviving layoffs year after year for 8+ years at that company.

Of course, anyone can get unlucky, layoffs can happen to anyone at anytime.  Nowadays, to protect themselves against age discrimination lawsuits, when laying certain people off, the hiring manager and their HR representative will give them a list of people who were laid off, the job titles and ages (not names), to try to document that age discrimination did not occur.

For blacks, females, and black females, it's even better.  With black males, when it's necessary to lay one off, the hiring manager will have an HR person present and tell them that ""there were four other people laid off, and you are the *last* person of those four to be laid off.""  This is to avoid the perception of ""white master getting rid of the colored darkies first,"" to put it colloquially.  Basically in no way does the company want to imply that blacks are the first to get laid off.

It gets even better with black females.  Companies are literally scared shitless of laying off black females, and so they'll terminate an entire department of 40 people of various ethnicity (white, black, asian), but keep the one black female on the payroll by virtue of her gender and color of skin, because they're afraid of getting sued for race-based employment discrimination due to the ""strong assertive black woman"" stereotype, for better or worse.",KarateJons,,False,t3_2to0lp,t3_2to0lp,False,-2,01-26-2015,0.9841,8.0,14.0,0.2711,"people, old, age, young, see, know, get, say, ageism, year"

Their modus operandi is to hire a fresh batch of new recruits, use them for a couple of years, lay them off, and then hire a fresh batch of newer recruits, since colleges will keep pumping out fresh graduates every few years.

If the new recruits break due to stress\burnout, it's more efficient to lay them off and replace them.  Plus, by laying them off frequently, the company saves salary raise money.  If you're paying 20 people $42,500 a year, and they each get a 1.5% raise, their salary is now slightly above $43,000.  A bean counting organization that wants to cut their way to profit, in their view it would be more efficient to layoff 10 people making $43,000, and hire 5-6 newer people making $42,500, to save the measly 1.5% x 10 from those whom were cut.

And there is also the stigma of being hired into an entry-level shop.  They never truly view you as someone who has ""real"" experience, since you joined as entry-level know-nothing n00b\baby.  They would still prefer to hire someone with 3-5 years ""real"" experience away from their competitors for leadership positions (minor leadership such as team lead, associate principal consultant, etc.), while having all these entry-level n00bs comprise a ""grunt force"" of weak and worthless expendables easily cut from the roster at any time.

My advice to young adults who gain entry-level positions, is to stay for a year or two until they have gathered ""real"" experience, and then GTFO immediately to a company that only hires experienced people, because the latter will actually value their employees more than the cheap labor grunt force operations.

I myself suffered through 8 years of higher education, in the end I hold a Master's degree, a Bachelor's degree, two certificates, and an Associate's degree.  I feel I am overeducated and the job opportunities that I get don't really take into account my educational attainments.  They don't mean shit in the eyes of the recruiters and corporations, whom only care how many years of experience I have, what tools and technologies I have used, and what roles I have previously held, in determining whether I would even be considered for future positions.

So I guess I'm cynical.  If I had been offered a ""real"" job when I was in school, I would have said ""fuck school"" and left immediately and taken the job.  I can see the argument for not doing so, since just having that bachelor's degree under one's belt might be good enough to get past those recruiters and corporations who actually discriminate based on whether or not one has a degree.

However, I guess there is somewhat of a catch-22.  Employers value experience most of all, so there is the story that a hiring manager would easily take someone with 10 years of experience and no degree, any day, over someone with 4 years of schoolin' but no real experience.  And then there is the stigma against entry-level n00bs and interns.  Recruiters don't consider internship experience as ""real"" experience, and will subtract those positions from your resume unless you omit the word intern.

So I guess my real question, to get past the bullshit and to the heart of the matter are as follows:

**What is the point of suffering and going to school for 4-8 years if the only thing employers care about is experience, and they are anti-n00b friendly and very few shops are entry-level, whom will even look at a candidate's resume if they don't have experience?

**What is the point of having internship experience if most recruiters and employers don't view it as ""real"" experience? How can it still not be enough?

I have found that to get ahead in life, one has to tell white lies, lie on one's resume as needed, master the art of bullshit artistry, and otherwise actually strive to build the 3-5 years of experience, to be taken seriously in their field, and even then, career transition is improbable, they will be stuck and pigeon-holed into that field for the rest of their careers.",KarateJons,,False,t3_2to0lp,t1_co12i4h,False,2,01-27-2015,-0.9792,-23.0,10.0,0.2513,"job, resume, experience, work, even, year, good, interview, talk, relevant"

I've kept myself relevant and up to date, have my own side projects and keep exploring things I don't use at work, yet.

Their company supports them in the way most tech companies (and a lot of other companies) do: They pay for 1-2 courses a year, as well as certificates that fit their field of work. They also offer a small budget for education materials like books. But they don't really offer any company organised education sessions.

You listed worker protection laws as a potential reason, but I think something else is more important: Germany only recently switched to a Bsc/Msc system, previously people would do a 5 year+ Diploma degree, that was basically a Bsc and a Msc done back to back. Due to this system it is still normal and expected that people do a Bsc and Msc back to back. Companies rarely hire Bscs as full time software developers.

2131,2131,28,cscareerquestionsEU,Older Software Developers in Germany?,gf9h4zq,"Hey, I am German working for one of the biggest Fintechs here in Europe. Probably I am on the other end of the spectrum in my early-middle 20s. In my company the average age is around 30 so you see some +40/+50-year-olds but you do not see them often. It is probably because my company fosters a kind of young culture. Changing things all the time and so on. But I can speak for the company my mom works at. She does not work there as a developer but has to interact sometimes with them. The company is some energy provider and it is super laid back from what I hear. People complain that there are not enough devs there but they also do not want to spend a dime on devs. So everything stays as it is. People normally stay there at least 5 years but it is not uncommon for some people to stay their whole life there. They train people with training sessions, you also have to be a bit active there yourself to get these training lessons, but it is possible. From what I can hear it is the same at big car manufacturers for example. They have more or less the same culture (simply more laid back).

Now a bit more into your specific points:


True, you have a generous notice period of 3 months by default in most companies. The longer you work there, the longer the notice period will be. If you get fired/laid off you have a big protection net because of unemployment money. Basically, you work for 12 months and pay taxes (around 50% of your pre-tax salary basically) and in case of getting jobless, you will get like 60-70% of your net salary for at least 6 months. The older the longer and also depends on your tenure time before.


Completely depends on the company. Can just tell the company my mom works at, you need to contact your boss and then it will be done.


Also exists in more traditional companies. They protect the workers and yeah, make everyone equal. Honestly, my own opinion: if you are a high performer this will be more of a blocker than an opportunity. In general, they do a good job. Especially about working rights for disabled people for example. It's a great thing to have I guess.

One question: How is your German? That needs to be really good to get into these traditional companies. Lots of older folks here in Germany simply do not speak English well enough.

That's good. I had a client last year where there gender mix was excellent, but it was also deliberate - a lot of thought had been put into how to avoid introducing accidental bias into the various parts of the hiring process.


I don't think it is about ""having the time"" to be biased - people just ""are"" biased to a greater or less degree. It doesn't take time, it's just a state of mind - and IMO one that can be reset. I have a pet theory that a lot of this is subconscious, and it is (mostly) not exhibited as misogyny or anything explicit. It's just a predominantly male audience, and a fraction of that audience is feeling nervous that the playing field is being levelled a bit more, reducing some of the accidental advantage they might have benefited from earlier in their career. For the most part, I don't regard men exhibiting subconscious gender bias as being mean-spirited, it's just a cultural and psychological phenomena.

I am a man, and am generally introverted, and in some fashion people think I ""look like"" an engineer. No-one has ever questioned my competence as an engineer based on my gender or characteristics. It's hard for me to measure how much I have benefited by not wasting mental energy fighting against people implying I am not in the right industry, or that I might be better suited to something else. I agree it doesn't happen for all women, and if it does not happen at your company that is to be celebrated, but I don't mind giving it some consideration for where it is happening.

Well let's run with the assumption that the typical IBMmer got a bachelors degree and entered the workforce at 22. And since the full retirement age is 66, let's assume that is when everybody would choose to retire. So that's 44 years in the workforce. 

Unless that quote is misleading, it sounds like 40% of IBM's layoffs were of people under 40, and 60% were of people over 40.

How far through those 44 years would you reach age 40?

About 40%.

Now I don't know what the distribution of IBM's workers looks like. But since the article paints the picture that IBM had a large number of workers that were getting older, maybe the distribution was biased toward the older side. If that's the case then the layoffs, as a proportion of the population, would have hit younger workers harder than older workers.

We also keep making the same mistakes over and over again: proprietary lock-in mainframe platforms that can't be migrated or worked with locally, smart networks and dumb endpoints (it should be the other way around), hierarchical rather than relational data models (NoSQL), over-architected systems, attempts to pre-specify entire complex systems before implementation (every single vaporware ""whitepaper""), trendy management methodologies that don't actually work, monolithic software that can't interoperate (""apps""), applications owning user data instead of data residing in a shared filesystem (and attempts to hide data objects from users in general), single-tasking UIs, touch screens (google ""gorilla arm""), and so on.

All these things were tried and abandoned for a reason. Now they're being tried again. Soon they will be abandoned again. Then another generation will try them again and abandon them again.

You even see it in novel areas like cryptocurrency where hordes of coders are working on proof of stake, an idea that was tried and found lacking in the earliest cryptocurrency efforts like Wei Dei's b-money in 1989. It wasn't until Satoshi invented a proof of work based system that we had robust byzantine consensus that was reasonably immune to at least the easier classes of manipulation and double spending attacks.

Jamie Zawinsky (one of the original Netscape coders) famously decried the [CADT development model](https://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html), which stands for ""Cascade of Attention Deficit Teenagers."" I've invented another term for what comes after CADT: the CHIT model. It stands for ""Cascade of Historically Ignorant Twentysomethings."" It's the dominant development model in Silicon Valley where generation after generation of eager techbros reinvents the same stuff over and over again, usually with each generation creating a more bloated and over-engineered incarnation of the same old ideas. This is part of what leads to ""erooM's law"", the observation that Moore's law is partially neutralized by the continuously decreasing efficiency and increasing bloat of software.

I'm not old, but I'm experienced and I work with a very diverse age range of peers. I am a consultant, I interview consultants, and I've been in the industry long enough to have had a lot of clients.

I work in the Dev/Ops space, which is a fairly young. I've observed that a lot of the people in this space are around my age, and that we tend to be younger than spaces like development, networking, desktop support, and QA.

My general observation is that having a lot of work experience doesn't necessarily translate to being a particularly effective worker. Having 3 decades of work experience tends to be less critical than being up to date on modern tech and practices. The absolute worst trait to have in this space is a resistance to change.

When I started my career, I had a general idea of everything I needed to learn to be an 'expert' in computing. Around the time I learned that stuff, I started to become somewhat actively hostile to new tech, and to the idea that something would replace/obsolete what I had already learned. I laughed at 'cloud,' and semi-dismissed containers. But eventually realized the value in those things, and now actively use them.

I've noticed a tendency among my peers for some to be happy doing what they are doing, and being where they are. Others are actively learning, experimenting with new technologies, and constantly looking at how new tools can improve their current processes. The former group, tends to become less valuable over the years, and the latter group tends to increase in value.

Some of the most skilled, highly regarded, and in-demand co-workers are the more experienced ones who bring knowledge of the latest technologies to bare along with their years of experience, and deep understanding of good practices and computing fundamentals.

I have a very hard time saying that there is or isn't an agism problem in the industry. However, I have observed that there's a trap that tends to push workers out of the industry, and tends to create opportunity for those who are eager to learn.

That's true, but I think the logic companies use is that there are more people that resemble the former than the latter, plus the older people tend to be more expensive, so using age as a filter is just one of those efficient heuristics that might filter out some good candidates but in general works well enough.

Actively networking is one antidote to this - if you're good, and people know you're good, it's much easier to get good, high-paying work than if you're just another resume in a pile.

I wasn't saying the React paradigm is bad-- in fact it's very very good. It's just not at all new. Data-driven UIs are as old as Smalltalk, Visual Basic (pre-dot-net), and many other systems. People were doing this kind of data flow on old workstations and 8-bit and 16-bit personal computers in the 70s and 80s. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLPiMl8XUKU

The two big paradigms are pure functional (like React) and data binding / observer based (old Visual Basic, Angular I think). IMHO pure functional is more robust and less bug prone but data binding / observer patterns are more productive and let you implement stuff very quickly.

My point is that when web UIs first started to get complex they started with data flow spaghetti code. You'd have jQuery commands to explicitly update controls and then onChange type handlers to update data structures when controls changed. It took the web dev world about a decade to fully rediscover and implement the functional or data binding paradigms that were used in desktop UIs since the Xerox Alto or even at Stanford Research Institute in the late 1960s.

I feel like a greater number of more experienced developers would have saved a generation of web developers a lot of time. ""Oh, you're doing a UI. We know how to do this. Here let's try some ideas we already know work well...""

2381,2381,30,programming,IBMâ€™s Ageism Could Mean a Grim Future for the Tech Industry,dwgig4f,"From my perspective, React *is* somewhat novel. It looks like it's borrowing the traditional server-side web app paradigm of ""whenever the user does anything, just re-render the page"", but twisted it so that it could quickly and surgically update the live DOM on the client. That's simultaneously very obvious, incredibly clever, and more than a little crazy. 

I've never used a traditional GUI framework that followed that same model. All the ones that I've used have been observation-based MVC frameworks. Everybody says that observer-based MVC frameworks are awkward or hard to get right, but that hasn't really been my experience. The paradigm certainly gives you more rope with which to hang yourself. In the right hands, you can use that rope to do impressive things. 

I don't know that React would have worked well in an age where a computer might only have a few megabytes of memory and might only run at a few megahertz. Despite what the React proponents say, there is a nontrivial amount of overhead in React's update model. Diffing the virtual DOM isn't free. From my (albeit limited) experimentation, updating the GUI by rendering a complex virtual DOM tree and sending that through the React pipeline is significantly slower than directly updating (either via something like jQuery or something like Knockout) the element that needs to be updated. Now, ""significantly slower"" might still be much faster than humans can perceive on the supercomputers that are on everyone's desk and in everyone's pocket. The massive advances in computer speed and efficiency might very well have been necessary for a React-like model to be viable. 

Ultimately, what's frustrating to me isn't React at all, but rather the underlying infrastructure of the web. The DOM APIs aren't nearly as rich as the widget APIs in more traditional GUI frameworks. And while I realize that is partly because the web was never designed for client-side applications, it does create an annoying impedance mismatch. It's frustrating to need to mirror data in the DOM and also in my client-side data model. In my mind, it's crazy that in the year 2018, the browser *still* provides no way to directly and declaratively connect your GUI to JS data. Things like Knockout shouldn't really be necessary because that functionality should be built in to the browser. 

But that digression aside, the GP commenter's point stands: a lot of thought went into ""the old ways"". I do worry that we, as an industry, spend so much time re-discovering (the hard way) things that were already known that we're not *really* making significant progress. Sure, React makes it easy to build interactive and consistent GUIs on the web. Great, but we were doing that with Java applets 20 years ago. Sure, the React model is (arguably) better than the Swing model and sure, Java applets required, well, Java, which wasn't a great citizen in the browser. But it's not like we've created some wholly new way to build apps; we've just finally mostly caught the browser up to where Smalltalk was nearly 40 years ago.",balefrost,,False,t3_87swl7,t1_dwg322i,False,3,03-29-2018,0.9761,15.0,0.0,0.4578,"thing, learn, new, get, know, use, year, make, code, stuff"
2382,2382,30,programming,IBMâ€™s Ageism Could Mean a Grim Future for the Tech Industry,dwgh9xc,"/u/api has the cause and effect totally backwards, and is quite wrong on several points of his original post and the reply to you. If you watch the first react announcement they explain it very well, but I’ll try to summarize. 

HTML, JS, and the DOM were not imagined to do the kind of things we currently try to do with them. This is particularly true of the DOM, it was not made to do the kind of fast state querying and resolution required for one way data flow. The web was originally static, so there wasn’t a concern of any data flow. 

The work around was the data flow spaghetti code he referred to. It’s absurd to assert that programmers just forgot everything and actually wanted to do it that way. No. It was done that way because (especially at the time) browsers are very slow to upgrade and if you want to leverage the web to host your software you have to deal with an environment that isn’t tuned for running dynamic content. 

React didn’t invent or re-invent uni-directional data flow. Again that is nonsense. What React did invent, and hopefully as a react developer you’ve heard of it, is the “virtual DOM”. The virtual DOM is quite a feat of engineering, the real DOM is very slow to do the necessary work for uni-directional data flow - again this is because it was designed and has baggage from an age of “no data flow”. So react stores an entirely new DOM that is tuned for uni-directional data flow, then when you change something in the very fast virtual DOM it figures out the smallest amount of changes that need to be done to the slow real DOM to reflect those changes. 

The idea that the paradigm was abandoned or re-invented is like going to Venice and saying “Omg, these idiots completely re-invented cars, only now they call them ‘Gondolas’” - it completely ignores the environment for the transportation vehicle is completely different.

My laptop is easily 100X as powerful as the desktops I had in the 90s, but much of the software it runs is dramatically worse.

I keep trying to find a good way to answer this. It seems like a simple question, but for some reason I don't have a simple answer.

In general, I feel that the IT field is like law, medicine, and science... It's a field where you do need to keep updating and refreshing your skills simply to maintain your current level of effectiveness. Tech has a shelf-life, and much as no one wants to shop at a market full of wilted vegetables, no one wants to hire a person who only knows stale tech.

I personally had to change my outlook on new tech. Rather than seeing it as threat; something that will obsolete what I already know... I Look at it as an opportunity; a new tech is something that's often gained a lot of interest, but there are few people who really understand it. By learning that new tech, I stand out.

For example, if you want to become an expert on Apache, you're going to be up against people who have been using it for 2 decades. If you want to become an expert on Kubernetes, you're up against people who have been using it for 2 years.

I try to look at the flaws in the tech I know, and look at how new tech can fix those flaws. I don't ignore the problems with new tech, but instead of using them as an excuse to dissmiss the tech, I ask if they make the new tech unsuitable or for my uses, or unready to be used in a live environment.

New technologies almost always gain traction because they try to solve problems. Sure, a bunch of stuff just tries to re-invent the wheel, but when something has gained a lot of inertia, it's often because there's some real potential there.

FWIW... There's nothing wrong with defending older tech. Old stuff often paved the way for new stuff. I was an expert on CFEngine, I am an expert on Puppet, and I am currently doing a bunch of stuff with Ansible. I can defend CFEngine and Puppet. But I'm also going to be honest about their weaknesses. I won't defending them in order to attack or dismiss Ansible.",burning1rr,,False,t3_87swl7,t1_dwh0zp7,False,2,03-30-2018,0.9798,5.0,5.0,0.3252,"work, people, year, old, time, age, also, tech, young, experience"

Really?  I don't remember it being much of an issue.  In fact, the massive security breaches are a fairly recent thing.  Web browsers are much better now, but nobody used web browsers for anything important in the 90s.  In terms of overall availability / uptime, I don't think it has changed much.  Things usually work, and there are occasional massive outages.  In the 90s, people didn't use commodity PCs for anything important, and the big IBM mainframes were (and still are) more reliable than almost any cloud solution.

Granted, I don't think it's an opportunity for older programmers with outdated skills to somehow put them to use.  Outdated skills are of not much use to anyone, and we are definitely not going back in time to do things in outdated ways.  That said, there are always opportunities for experienced, battle-hardened engineers, but that assumes they are competent and stay up to date with the latest technologies.

An individual cannot negotiate against this. An engineer who asks to be exempted from Agile nonsense or open-plan offices will be steamrolled. He has no leverage. And programmers, as a group, are too fucking stupid to unionize and kill this shit.

0. Poorly defined scope which led to a terrible foundation (the web is just a network based document viewer)
0. Bad foundation leading to light abstractions and general feature confusion (jQuery was mostly just a way to unify browser APIs. It wasn't intended to be a UI framework.)
0. Lack of ecosystem (and pretty much the instant we fixed it, we came up with Angular and then soon React)
0. ""the web isn't really programming"" both in reality and stigma led to most of the web being written by people without formal education, regardless of age 

I'm not sure I'd say the bad paradigms existed and failed because the programmers failed to take inspiration from older technologies. I think they largely succeeded at their goals in spite of poorly defined scope and understanding of what the web was, could do, and could mean.

Also keep in mind the DOM is very slow, and the exact code (or similar) running my website today simply would not have run quickly enough to be functional in 2006.

If I were forced to pick, I would say that's more of an Angular thing (which *has* been largely abandoned in favor of React, which has a unidirectional data-flow observation pattern). React is more of a functional paradigm. I might describe it more appropriately as a heavily-memoized, large function that takes ""state"" (sometimes as just one object, like a model) and returns a UI. But individual parts of the UI (components) don't really ""observe"" the data. They're defined as functions that act upon the data, kind of like a computed property but for UI. React generally isn't very ""MVC"" in the way that Angular is/was. It's really just the view layer. Redux is kind of like a model and a controller in one, but I do generally think a typical React application isn't very well described by ""MVC"" in the same way I learned it.

But... what's wrong with that pattern? Either MVC or observers. That's my real question. I hear a lot ""The web is just reinventing the wheel that was invented and abandoned"", but the point there is to show what's wrong with the web rather than just likening it to things that have other problems. React, for example, is okay with third-party stuff. At least as much as any other web view framework. Angular kind of sucked (you largely couldn't even use browser APIs because they weren't always compatible with the Angular lifecycle).

It took decades for the industry to finally move towards implementing systems which could handle the running of remote services without proprietary plugins.

While I don't completely share your point of view on all things (perhaps partly due to our differing experiences), I always find what you write to be interesting. I think we've exchanged comments before.

I've spent my entire career on the east coast. I've mostly lived and worked in the suburbs, but I spent a few years in NYC. I've done work both for companies where software is their product and for companies where software is just in service of their actual product. 

Everything I read about silicon valley makes it seem like a completely different world than the world I'm in. So much so that I don't really consider myself to be part of the ""tech industry"", despite working for a company that builds and sells commercial software. Sure, you run into politics and dysfunction everywhere. But I get the impression that SV is a pressure cooker. Everybody's bought into Paul Graham's idea that only idiots stay as wage slaves (which IIRC you commented on), so everybody thinks they need to be a founder if they want to amount to anything at all. I get the impression that people are less focused on solving problems with technology than they are on pumping their startup so that they can finally *be* somebody. And because *everybody's* doing that, it is very much suffused into the culture. You can't escape it.

Now I've never lived out there, so my impression is based solely on what I've read. But if what I said rings true at all, then it's worth mentioning that, at least in my experience, those problems aren't universal in the software world.

I don't know a ton about you. I don't know for sure that you're in SV, but from what you've said and what I know you've commented on in the past, it's at least a reasonable inference. If you really want to change the world with technology, then SV might still be the best place to go. I don't know. But if you just want to write excellent software to solve real people's problems, then there are plenty of companies outside that sphere. *Everybody* needs software these days. I'd bet that most developers at my company would not recognize your name, and I can almost guarantee that the managers have never heard of you.

Well, not good. My goal isn't to make you feel dumb. You're not dumb. But you're 19, and how long have you been programming? I've arguably been programming in some form for over 25 years, and the amount that I do know is just a drop compared to the ocean that I don't know.

Learning things takes time, and the more time you spend, the more opportunities you get to learn things. So don't feel bad that you don't know something. Instead, channel that into something productive. Try to learn about the thing!

The trick for the industry is to figure out how to benefit from the accumulated wisdom of people who have been doing this for longer without getting stuck in a ""this is how we've always done it"" mindset. Because progress is only made when we create new things, it's easy to assume that all new things represent progress. It's often worthwhile to look at older things for inspiration. 

I'll bet that most JS developers would become better JS developers if they spent some time with Lisp, which is old enough that it could collect senior-citizen benefits. At the same time, it's important to not fetishize Lisp. It's in many respects an excellent language, especially for certain kinds of work, but it's by no means a universally ideal language. It has tradeoffs just like every other language.

In fact, the cooperation of the unions and the corporations is the single biggest reason germany avoided massive unemployment with such an export oriented economy and is a big driver in companies staying competetive and sustainable in the long term against pressures such as from venture capital and hedge funds because the union reps get seats on the board of directors if a company is big enough. It is their vested interest to keep profitability sustainable to sustain the wages of the people they represent, instead of just having profit as a goal. The system works well and most of the problems with it usually come from companies trying to supress unions to not have them get in the way of the quick and easy money, not from unions being competetive.

It works in other places, it works well, it is based on the principles of democracy and the free market, why on earth would it be bad? Because of 150 years of propaganda deeply rooted in the collective subconscious. That's literally the only reason. To believe otherwise is usually just a stupid case of american exceptionalism.

IBM paid to get it certified. No one's paid for Git to get certified.
Managers choose IBM.

If that matters is up to debate depending on who you talk to. Everyone **knows** ISO 26262 & IEC 61508 is coming. You hear rumors about the exact date your products need to be certified. You really don't understand it but you understand it's VERY IMPORTANT and if your product doesn't meet the requirements your business will suffer and you may get fired. Billions of dollars. *Don't* make killer robots. [Think: Caterpillar, Eaton, VW, Mercedes-Benz, GM, Toyota, Cummins, John Deere, Ford, CNH. Yes that's what us developers are preparing for, not React]

In rolls in IBM snake oil salesmen on stagecoaches and tells you about their ISO 26262 certified tonics. They say the ONLY way to meet ISO 26262 requirements A, B, C are with IBM tonic. They tell the managers that Git is FREE, and FREE is not good. Toss in the fact that most of them say 'the git' and have no idea the difference between Atlassian, GitLab, GitHub let alone all the other nuances that come with it.

So they look at their budget, it has a line for ""IBM"" in it. Next year IBM salesmen are asking for a bit more, you can swing it. Plus all your existing staff from 30-65 already know how to use IBM tools. Retraining would be infinitely more expensive than just paying IBM off.

Even when I switched over from web development to software with CDI-ized Java, it was pretty quick to pick up how it all works. I would be surprised if a seasoned developer struggled to understand the JS ecosystem. IMO it's one of the more predictable languages. Except, maybe, the asynchronous stuff, but it's also the one ""threading"" pattern in JS so that keeps it relatively simple. The rest of JS is kind of typical across the board, isn't it? A file for managing dependencies. (eg. gradle, gem, cargo, NuGet), imports at the top of files, listeners for events (eg. request handlers, QT sockets), then your typical language-oriented primitives and standard libraries.

Yeah, but you should hire older people not to solve tickets, but rather run the place!  Its hard to run the place if you don't understand a lot of the technology stack.  Why would a Junior dev ever listen to their superior if their superior can't understand the differences between module loading standards, or what a PWA is and how SSO works.  

The list of frontend oddities is so large now a days, that without intense understanding of the entire modern platform, I'd be warry spending 120K on a senior engineer.  


I mean, these are staples in the technology field.  Without solid foundation in the entire ecosystem, implementing these into real world business applications is begging  to turn to spaghetti. 


The entire way that javascript applications are built is atypical and unique.  There's a bunch of independent implementations of every single part.  On top of that, it's the ONLY ecosystem with a package management system that supports both backend and frontend packages.  

Question I always ask that barely anyone gets: 

1. What's the difference between a backend npm package and a frontend npm package.
2.  Do you know any examples of objects that aren't available in backend.  Why aren't they available? 
3.  What's a CORS request?  Why is it important? 
4.  How does a client accept a Cross origin request? 
5.  What's the difference between a subscription and a promise?  Why is there this distinction to begin with?  
6.  What is rxjs?  

These questions may seem simple.  But finding someone who knows these very basic things is actually very hard.  So the question then becomes, ok, well, I'm going to have to train someone extensively so that they become extremely familiar with these concepts.  Without those fundamentals, you're begging for enterprise disaster.

A couple days ago, I wrote an article (posted here) about the [low social status of software engineers and the issues that causes](http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2014/07/13/how-the-other-half-works-an-adventure-in-the-low-status-of-software-engineers/). The ageism comes from the colonizing culture: mainstream business culture, a 20th-century hangover that hasn't died yet (often called ""MBA culture"" in software). MBA culture is intensely ageist (you're expected to be a Director by your mid-30s, VP by early 40s, and so on) and justifies it as an up-or-out culture. The idea that talented people might not want to climb management hierarchies at all isn't considered.  

It's also easier to convince young people to take on stupid risks. Compensation is a part of it (it is, after all, risky to be underpaid) but it's also about conformance to authority and the blind willingness to stick with a dead project (""death march""). Then you have the [VCs, who did their 20s wrong and are vicariously living through young sociopaths](http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/12/14/vc-istan-6-the-isms-of-venture-funded-technology/) so they fund a bunch of stupid rich kids who mistake their inability to attract and retain senior talent for a problem with ""old people"" in general. 

Ageism in software *is* bullshit. Older programmers dislike flashy, unproven technologies not because they don't want to learn them, but because they have seen certain mistakes before and tend to abhor unnecessary complexity. Non-relational (""NoSQL"") databases have their place, but if you have to learn five of them just to maintain a simple web service, then something is most likely being done wrong. 

The young people who are creating the ageism are the ones who confused ""I can't find good older people *who want to work for me*"" with ""there are no good older people out there"". The problem is that we've let our MBA-culture colonizers redefine ""software engineer"", once an R&D role, as a business subordinate. You can pretty easily find skilled older people who'll work for you, where ""work for"" means ""provide services for""... but if ""work for"" means ""take a subordinate role"", age inversion just makes it socially untenable for both sides, in almost all cases. Older programmers can do fine, if they manage to become consultants, but that's a different skill set. 

The truth is that the typecasting of programmers to business subordinates is just completely inappropriate.

Many software developers think their experience and skill makes them better. That is probably true. 

Here's the issue, businesses create job roles and fill those.
What makes a good software developer in 90% of cases is everything he does outside of his job role.

For example. Currently at work, we have a team to setup environments and deployments. Theoretically, this group of people knows the environment inside and out and can handle this. We also have various test teams. Theoretically, these groups of people know about the product, can write test cases... The same goes for architecture, documentation, database management...

Imagine this world for a second. All a developer does is write software. Everything else is handled by the appropriate team and knowledge is kept in design documents and specs. How much do you think your extra experience and skill is worth? Unless you're writing some all-star algorithm, not much.

Reality of course does not work like this. Developers end up fixing and setting up environments, dealing with databases, dealing with networking...  Businesses push for software release, and developers grind away in all the other areas to get it done.

It is in all this *other* work that a skilled developer really emerges. But the key is that from a high level view, that which organizes companies, the developer is just a developer... and thus... is a replaceable cog that can be replaced be anyone who can code.

Developers ultimately like to be superheroes. It is actually quite harmful as if developers stuck to simply developing, projects would not get finished and management would actually have to address the issues in the rest of the software team (test, environment, database, architecture...). But they are unrecognized superheroes from a high-level perspective.

Nobody can man the front lines forever. Your body, attention, ambition, drive, and interests can't handle it. Whether it's firing a machine gun or sitting at a desk, there will always be pressure, and when the pressure is on, it's harder to hold up when you're older. 

Otherwise, why doesn't the military employ thousands of senior citizens for programmers since they have the most experience and may have been working on computers since they started installing them in submarines.

It's nothing personal. In order to stay successful, you need to move up in your career. If you're happy just being a grunt, that's one thing, but what happens when your teenage son is sick at home and your wife is out of town and the project you are working on is up against a hard deadline?

It has nothing to do with being able to pay young people less. It has nothing to do with young people being less willing to say no. It has nothing to do with any of these made up reasons that are getting thrown around more. 

The fact is, in general (not always), young people are more driven and eager to succeed. Middle age people are more settled into their life and careers. This is an absolute generality, but I figured I could throw one out there since so many are being thrown around from the opposite direction.

**Seriously ask yourself this question**

Let's say someone gave you $1 million in seed funding to start a company. Who would you want helping you on your new app you want to start a company with? The middle aged guy who costs you 10-15% of your seed money, tells you all the time he already knows how to do something bc he's done it 18 times before, and goes home at 5:30, but doesn't make as many mistakes, or the young, eager fighter who may make more mistakes, but also busts ass to make the project successful because he want's to be a part of something and constantly comes up with new ideas, and costs 5% of your seed money?

Why should a big company be any different? Because they have more money? 

No. Drive and passion count for a lot in business. They inspire everyone around them. They drive companies forward with new ideas.

Older, settled programmers may make less mistakes and have experience, but they are also more settled into their way and less open to new ideas. You've done the same thing 18 times already? Ok, well I'd like to try to do it different. Are you going to be open to that? Or pout because you already know how to do it and think I'm second guessing you or trying to tell you how to do your job?

I know this is personal for a lot of you who don't want to move into management, but instead want to keep grinding for the rest of your lives, but from a businesses point of view it isn't personal. 

It's to get the job done and move up as a company. Or the company will be moving out also.

I'm firmly of the opinion it's just the relative youth of the discipline. Every 60-year-old programmer who started when they were 20 _must_ have started 40 years ago. All such programmers must therefore draw from the set of programmers programming in 1974, and still have survived this long as programmers (to say nothing of literal survival). The number of such programmers is therefore forever bounded at the top by the number of programmers in 1974, which is certainly non-zero, but equally certainly quite small compared to the number of programmers today.

As the discipline matures, I think we're going to see ever-increasing acceptance of older programmers simply by virtue of there being more of them.

I think it's already happening. The ""young guy who knows more than all his elders"" meme is not dead, but it is greatly diminished, and is nearly dead outside of the media. I'm 35 and I've been programming professionally for about 17 years, and the primary threat the ""smart young guys"" pose to me is the mess that they are going to make in the code.

Also, no sarcasm, to an increasing degree the people I see lamenting about how fast the industry is moving is the _young_ programmers, upset at how much stuff they seem to need to know just to put together a simple dynamic web page. It's the older programmers who have been through enough to see through to the common underlying similarities. (JS framework churn is a lot of sound and fury, signifying little. There _have_ been changes to web programming in the past 15 years, yes, but the _real_ rate of change is much, _much_ slower than meets the eye if you just track JS framework news. Again, no sarcasm, if you were a skilled IE4 developer I could bring you up to speed on the modern web in a few weeks. IE4 introduced dynamic HTML, and `.innerHTML`, and that's still probably the largest single change ever made to the web programming world.

You can't have 10 years of experience with something 2 years old.

But today's older people *are* those young people who tried computers in greater numbers, plus 10-20 years of experience.

- Pulling all-nighters to fix code that an experienced person would have gotten right beforehand.

I'm speculating productivity probably has a bi-modal curve; where there are peaks early and late in one's career.

The best programmers I know are ones where computers are their primary hobby as well as their job  (probably true of other fields too; but it's easier to see in programming).   It takes an awful lot of time to keep up with all the stuff to stay great - especially if your 9-5 job spends most of it's time working with legacy/near-obsolete tools.    That means having a lot of time outside of working hours to keep studying / experimenting / etc on home networks, hobby projects, etc.   Toward the middle of their careers it's likely that other time-consuming commitments/hobbies/etc come up -- perhaps investing in the stock market, perhaps buying a house, perhaps raising a family.

Well, this is not incorrect.

And you need to do this while keeping every single internet-capable device in mind, as well as performance and bandwidth constraints.

My rates can be pretty low now, but with two exceptions, the only people who have made me offers are people I knew and worked with before--and the two exceptions are people who came to me through my network of colleagues.

One hypothesis would be that I was just a crappy programmer, and that I somehow managed to conceal it from everybody for fifteen years. But then, if that were so, you would expect that the people who knew me best would be the most reluctant to hire me, instead of being the most eager.

If Valley employers don't take things like age and infirmity into account when making hiring decisions, then the sharp change in my fortunes just as I happened to develop a serious incurable illness would be a very odd coincidence.

I'm a young coder, and I've known coders all over the spectrum at all ages. One of my best teachers had been doing it for well over 15 years, and I have him to thank for a better attitude and approach to testing, a smarter coding style that makes staying DRY easy, and helped me figure out how to get to my 'zone' faster every day.

At the same time, I've met people 11 years in who I wholeheartedly coded better than within my first 8 months of having a real development gig. The guy who writes individual unit tests in a group(instead of repeat running setup for similar tests, thereby not accidentally fucking up results by observation/happenstance), the one who don't write the basic functionality tests because ""I know it works"", the ones who build monolithic systems with dozens of moving parts where any one failure causes the whole column to come down.

There are obvious things someone in their second year should be capable of, things people in their 3rd year should know, etc. If you're in web development and you don't understand the basics of HTTP(Headers, response, status code lookup, HTTP methods) by the end of your first year, you're behind.

If you use an MVC-based framework and don't understand what goes in a view, vs a helper, vs a controller, vs a model by your second year, you're inevitably creating massive technical debt that's going to bite everyone in the ass.

And for people in their 3rd year- by here, I feel like the most important thing is the ability to see and predict moderate problems before they happen. When you can look at the architecture of some model relations and say, ""This is going to cause confusion."" When you can consistently break a very large project down into dozens of small, confirmable tasks. When you build things that can last forever, but are still easy to rip and replace.

**The problem I have so often with older coders is a tendency to be too comfortable with complexity.**

You don't need to worry about what happens when your database-based scheduler gets to be a hangup on your database when you're struggling to get your first hundred users(and so, don't spend 3-4 days getting a more robust scheduler in).

Just because you can use recursion doesn't mean it's a good idea. In fact, if it's got a big, complicated name, you're probably already approaching it wrong, or you're making things needlessly complex to justify that degree(looking at you, dependency injection).

First off, how am I exploiting anybody? You don't know anything about me.


Long periods sitting in a chair, staring at the screen, back aching, neck stiff. Sure you could get up and take a walk every 15 minutes. but that's not something you want to do when you're getting something done.


Sure, I never said it didn't, but does it get more motivated?  Does someone in their 50's who's 5 years away from their retirement care about driving the company forward to succeed? Do they have any motivation to come up with new ideas? Or are they probably going to be more satisfied doing their job and then clocking out and going home to their wife and kids?


I don't know what this sentence means. I'm going to assume it's sarcasm, claiming I don't want to listen to 'old geezers'.

Well, that's not what I said at all. I said, that exactly like the guy in the article, some experienced programmers have trouble doing things differently because they already know better. Theyre set in their ways. Ever hear the saying ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks""? That saying wasn't just made up for no reason. This blogger went out of his way to say he had done these things 18 times already and made every mistake in the book.

This is exactly NOT the kind of person I want working for me. I want someone who isn't afraid to make mistakes and try something completely new. I want someone who isn't going to say, ""I've done this 18 times, I know what I'm doing"", but instead will say, ""How can we do it this time better than anyone else, even if it's so different it will make people cringe"". 


Thats a gross oversimplification of what I said. I said if a technology company in this day and age isn't continuously moving forward and upward, than they are liable to find themselves left far behind. 

Just ask Microsoft, who at least had the money to burn, although I'm sure they wish they hadn't. Or Blackberry. Who's hanging on by their teeth after finally waking up from their slumber. Or Yahoo, who didn't want to change anything since the 90's. Or any of the countless companies that have gone out of business in the last 20 years. Sun? AOL? Atari? Palm? Many of those companies shouldn't have had to be sold. 

[Here is a list of 21 tech companies that were changing the world and then died](http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/21_tech_companies_changed_world_they_died). Notice anything similar about these companies? A lot of them never moved with the times.

I think the worst end of age discrimination comes with IT/admin roles rather than programming. That's both due to the constant churn in tools and technology and the decline of admins as a specialized role as deployment and management tools make it easier for developers to work without dedicated admins.

If you know the fundamentals and can contribute in a meaningful way to designing a new system, you will probably have employment for life; if your skill set is based around a certification that gets renewed every three years on a curriculum that gets rewritten every 5-10, there isn't a lot of reason to prefer experience. 

There are admins who really understand how the systems work and can make those kind of contributions, but they are self-selecting and tend to move into other roles if they stick around (managers if they are good at dealing with non-techie people, developers if they are good at automating their own job).

I really dislike the age bias that you see in tech, but at the same time I would be deeply suspicious of a candidate who was still doing the same sort of admin or support role at 50 that they were doing at 20 or 30- not because they are old per se, but because it indicates that they haven't grown professionally.",ComradeGnull,,False,t3_2auwwu,t1_ciz4oxx,False,8,07-16-2014,0.3359,4.0,16.0,0.2667,"get, year, time, learn, much, new, work, people, job, go"

I also wasn’t being literal about needing to be on the cutting edge, there is absolutely no reason learning everything about every new framework or tool just because it’s there, what I meant is there is no point using .Net 3.5 rather than .Net 4.5 on a new project. 

I know people who will doggedly stick to the same framework well after an upgrade citing that they “know it works”. I think that’s very dangerous stance for a developer to take, in our field it really doesn’t take long for your knowledge to become outdated, and that, I think, is where a lot of the age debate comes from.

I guess what I’m saying is that it doesn’t have anything to do with age, but everything to do with not keeping up your skills up to date, the reason younger developers don’t get stuck in this trap as easily is that they have a lot less skills to be lazy with, a new developer that has only used MVC isn’t going to think to himself “it will be easier if I will just use web forms” but an older developer with experience with web forms might. And that’s the trap we all need to avoid unless we want to be that annoying project manager who used to be a developer :P

Like in any other profession, experienced programmers sometimes quit the field, FIRE, or move into management tracks. But I'm surprised that I had to scroll down to the end to find this quote, though it's the only statement needed to invalidate the argument of ""there's few old programmers, so that means most stop at age 40"".

Having a PC with internet in every home was only becoming a thing maybe 20-25 years ago, so it's not surprising that only then did (1.) the need for more and more SE's and (2.) the amount of people with affinity for computer that would get into the field see a big rise. According to some of the numbers on the Wikipedia page for [SE demographics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering_demographics), we had more than 6 times as many Software Engineers in 2016 compared to 2002. Comparing 2021 to 1995 would, if I'd had to guess, show a substantially bigger difference. And if you'd start programming in 1995, at age 15, you'd just now move into the 40+ age bracket.

Having more and more people start in the field as time goes on will give you a pyramid-shaped age distribution. That's not really a big surprise.",Taedalus,,False,t3_o92fic,t3_o92fic,False,41,06-27-2021,-0.8626,3.0,5.0,0.476,"work, people, year, old, time, age, also, tech, young, experience"

I really didn't mean that, and my comment went specifically in that direction: some spaces are competitive, some less so. If you feel like you can't keep up in a highly competitive space, go in a less competitive space. In other words, if you were already working hard to stay competitive at a younger age, getting older won't automatically alleviate that, but if you tweak your strategy a bit you can go places.

There are juniors in their 20s who just get by and do what's coming at them and not much more, I've also met ""juniors"" in their (late) 20s who were extremely competitive (using the term ""genius"" was a bit tongue-in-cheek) and could outdo most older engineers I've ever met.

Clearly, these were only ""junior"" in age, they were all senior by title and function at this point, and I think most of the time the gap could be explained by them starting earlier, generally being extremely eager, and doing *a lot* of ""productive"" stuff. They managed to amass a wealth of both direct experience from top-of-the-shelf companies and a healthy network of similarly minded people (= more opportunities / force multiplier).

It does make me a little uncomfortable that we have HR departments dedicated to Recruitment programs targeting college students. The internships I am good with. I am not good with The two year “interview process” 

After the internship, we invite the student back after graduation to work for a year paid. If we still like them, the are invited *by a different department* to work with them for a year. If we still like the we offer as a permanent employee position. Also, if you want to offer a position to a 2nd year, your department must have the budget to hire them for a 3rd year.

My problems are: A 2 year interview is just silly in a work at will state and, this is the big one, HR pays for the employee for the internship and subsequent two years. After that, the hiring department pays.

The effect is teams use this program to score “free” labor. You get an employee that has no bad habits and is hungry to do great AND doesn’t cost your department budget. I used this resource for years as a way to get around not having enough budget. 

I stopped when I decided that I wasn’t going to do the extra work to spin up a new dev only to have them leave to a department with a 3rd year budget. AND I realized by doing this I was not incentivizing my department to creat a real position for a real hire. That meant the scales were tipped heavily in the younger college students favor vs experienced devs.

Ageism comes up a lot in terms of people talking about tech jobs and to be truthfully honest I've only ever experienced it as a junior. 

When I was a younger dev, I worked on teams with much, much more senior developers - and simply based on circumstance - generally I was the youngest developer and often times the only junior. (e.g. I was an engineer on a team at 22 where the next youngest person was in their late 40s)

My ideas, opinions, etc. didn't matter on those teams. I've flat out been told during a meeting that I'm too young to know what I'm talking about and was made fun of due to my young age. 

I could look back and chalk this up to me being a starry-eyed, enthusiastic young developer at the time that was just spouting off opinions without actually knowing what I was talking about - but looking back at every situation where this happened, now as a grey-beard dev, I can say that I was right during those circumstances and those other devs were wrong.

I work 36 hours a week and, aside from conferences and some stuff I just do for fun, all my learning is 'on the job'. I think people vastly overstate the amount of personal time that is needed to stay up to date. You just have to be picky.

Also as I get older I see that a lot of stuff is just a new iteration of stuff that already existed. There have not been any massive shifts since the invention of the internet IMHO. The biggest shift, the cloud, has mostly been a slow evolution.


That's my experience too. They are 'valueable' for the company due to their domain knowledge. They often create a little kingdom inside the company only they know about. But that knowledge doesn't transfer to other companies.

So when they have to move (it's often because they're not getting promoted or simply are being laid off) they find out that they won't be considered for positions anywhere close in salary to the ones they were moving from.

You contradict yourself with your first statement. You DO have a bias against people before you even talk to them.  


Given that I have over 15 years of experience, maybe I've got a little better perspective and context into these so called worthless dinosaurs. Would I question why they're looking for a lower responsibility lower paying job? Sure, I would question them, by asking them in an interview. You'd be surprised what answers you might here. Some may admit they're just not as quick as they used to be, or others may tell you that they're not interested in a startup mentality or 10+ hour work days. Or maybe they've got kids and they're looking for something that they know they can do easily in an 8 hour window and leave at the office to focus on something they care more about.  

The thing I don't think you realize yet is that everyone has a life and as you get older your life tends to expand outside of the workday.  People don't always code for the love of the game, sometimes its just a paycheck, and dismissing solid engineers who will happily punch the clock and deliver on time in exchange for a paycheck is one of the most critical needs across the industry right now.  If you're actually in a position of hiring you would realize how hard it is to find anyone with a basic competency to want to work somewhere that isn't throwing money at them, some kind of unicorn, or they're just looking for a JOB and not a lifestyle.

3674,3674,37,ExperiencedDevs,Just how much ageism have you experienced as experienced dev?,i2uj59h,"I said I don’t discriminate against anyone.  I think it’s probably unfair to say no one has bias at all, I’m sure we all form a potential image of someone before meeting. But the thing is not to act on that - which is the thing I’m trying to make clear, I never discriminated against anyone when hiring even though looking at their cv I felt there was something that wouldn’t be quite right with the candidate applying for that particular job when their level of experience doesn’t match up to the role and salary offered. 

I also had candidates I went into interviews thinking would be great and rejected them, and some I thought wouldn’t do well who I put forward to further rounds. I’m not basing hiring decisions off my ideas based on their cvs but off their performance in interviews. 

And I’d like to point out I never called these people worthless dinosaurs. I did make a point to ask about what they liked about this particular job and their history and what they were looking for. I try keep all my phone screenings informal to keep it low stress and more like a conversation etc to give people the best chance, but sometimes it is clear it’s not working and that’s what I got from some of these people. 

Also a big thing is I’m in the UK, work hours are 7.5 a day here, and especially with the company they were applying to and coming from. These weren’t people working startups or 10h days anywhere. No one was coming from FAANG or even well known companies and we weren’t based in London with high expectations. 

I’m a very big advocate for a good work life balance and do realise people have a lot going on outside of work and might want a more chilled out job. That’s fine, and to be honest if someone wants a job because of the money, or any reason it’s fine too. What I don’t think it’s acceptable is if to every question you come across as dead inside, or can’t talk about a project you did with even the vaguest sense of interest, if you can’t hold a conversation or go into anything more than superficial depth about your work.  

I’ve advocated for candidates of all ages, from both traditional and non traditional routes into this. Age isn’t an issue, the same as I don’t care about your background.  What I care about is someone who will treat building an application like a craft and put care and attention into their work, I don’t think hiring code monkey type devs helps anyone, I want to have devs who can get involved in a technical discussion and propose solutions to problems, who pay attention to details and care about their work. 

If I don’t get a sense of someone being able to do that then I can’t realistically recommend they be hired for a job needing that. Especially when I have other candidates who talk about the work they have done and how they want to be involved and do things and show some care in what they do.  

I’ve worked with devs of all ages across my career, some have been great others just there for a paycheque, some had really broad skill sets and others were really specialised. I’d like to believe I’ve treated them all the same way, and I can safely say that every candidate I’ve rejected has been for a good reason. 

My personal take on the candidates I felt were overqualified and going for a lower job than they possibly should have was it was all burnout. They just lost that interest or seemed really beat down by working at a bad job for years. And I get it and wish I could do something. But I know the damage that comes from hiring someone who doesn’t meet criteria.

You're responding to a bunch of shit that /u/CrepsNotCrepes never said or even implied.

You've obviously got some idea in mind of who/what they are, and that's the target you want to have a go at.  I don't think you're targeting the right person though.  Very little you're claiming to ""know"" about them is at all relevant to what they originally said.
