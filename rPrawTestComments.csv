1,cscareerquestions,Do DevOps suffer less ageism as compared to software developers?,i9y815t,"I think the real straight-up ageism stuff mostly happens to people 60+. I'm in my late 40s and I really haven't experienced it so much. Getting my first gig was hard but it's hard for a lot of people and I was able to use my prior work experience to leverage my way into things to some degree.

I've got to be honest, I don't want to sound like I'm dismissing this altogether but most ""ageism"" I see - and I have seen older developers have issues staying in jobs - has less to do with ""Company X won't hire me because I'm 50"" and more to do with ""I've been doing this for 25+ years and somehow, somewhere along the lines I stopped learning new things"". I see a *lot* of older DBAs locked into DBA work because they only really know SQL/Oracle/et al and never even got on board the C#/Java train, much less Python or the new hotness with JS (by which I mean stuff like node and React). There are still a lot of places that still need people who can work their way around RDBs (I mean, hell, I'm not even slightly a DBA and I'm the point man for SQL on my team because I'm willing to do it) so there are still jobs but any time you cordon yourself off from being able to do certain kinds of work, you're lowering the number of companies that can hire you whether you're 25 or 65.

The other thing I think I see - and this is one place where I guess I get that special insight since I've ""only"" been in dev for around a decade at my age - is that industry standards shift around and people aren't always willing to pursue the new thing. For example, back to the database thing it used to be the most important thing in the business to conserve data use, like virtually any time you were repeating data you wanted to create a mapping table or what have you to not have to do that. Now data storage is kind of cheap and there are lots of noSQL type DBs that encourage you to do this. Even with my scant 10ish years of experience I get all kinds of internal red flags about this - what if the duplicated data needs to be updated? What if stuff is off from one record to the next? But the thing is, that ship has sailed and if you waste too much time demanding that we stick with the old ways because the old ways are better (and again, sometimes in many ways they *are* better), you won't learn how to work with the new ways, and when the next shift comes, it's more than likely not going to be ""let's just scrap all this and go back 20 years"", it's going to be ""let's do this new thing based on that thing you didn't want to do"".

I think peoples' minds tend to calcify as they get older as well and that in particular is something you just cannot allow to happen in software development, period.",johnnyslick,,False,t3_uxecmu,t3_uxecmu,False,12,05-25-2022,0.9492,18.0

Is it possible you're just not keeping your skills up to date? Devops can be significantly more aggressive about keeping skills updated, since you don't really have much control over the stack you're using and the field itself is still relatively young, resulting in a lot of shifting standards. I don't know that I'd call the required skills considerably lower in most cases. 

Well, not for good devops. A lot of companies are still trying to figure out what that looks like, though, so there's a certain amount of ""easy to get, easy to hold"" work in the devops field at the moment. I wouldn't expect that to last as the industry defines what is and isn't good practice a bit more.

Software Engineering is more a set of practices to designing and building software that were adapted from other fields of engineering.

**EDIT:** To revise, it would be more accurate to say that Software Engineering has **origins** in traditional engineering, but has evolved into something very different over the decades. My understanding is things like the [Waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) are early attempts to adapt traditional engineering methodologies to software engineering, but they never worked well in practice and aren't used much anymore. Today, Agile and Scrum methodologies are much more common.

I found this page on Wikipedia, [History of software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_software_engineering), which mentions a ""software crisis"" from the 60s to 80s that raised a lot of questions about how to better build software. Of course, some people had the idea to try to adapt traditional engineering methodologies to software development, many of them likely having a background in some field of engineering.

Also generally, a licensed engineer (an engineer who has earned that title) is signing off on designs that can have catastrophic impact on the users, so a engineer must sign off these designs and holds the responsibility for all issues. If you are negligent then you can lose the title, the same principles apply to doctors or lawyers.

The truth is, 95% of SWE jobs won’t fulfill that need. A job is a job - you do your work, you get paid, you go home. Any attempt to squeeze your job for anything more than what it is, a job, will most likely end in disappointment. Treat your job as a job, because that is what it is.

Do you still want to have a positive impact? I think thats a wonderful goal to have as a way of life. Start thinking about how you can make the world better as a human being. Perform acts that advance you towards your goals and make the world a better place. Perhaps you should donate 10% of your income to charity, or maybe you should plant a community garden, or feed the homeless, or anything really! Do whatever works for you.

Life insurance and 401k stuff might be boring, but having effective vehicles for retirement/financial security is very important. Are they first world, relatively wealthy problems to solve? Yes. Are they important? Also yes.

Imagine if you couldn't set up or make changes to your retirement funds because all the software developers in the world went 'fuck this, I'm going to do something important', and went to do mental health startups. Imagine if someone died and their kids couldn't collect their life insurance because the database crashed and ate their information, or sent it to the wrong benefactor.

Again, are these end-of-the-world kind of problems? No, they're mundane problems, but they're life-changing for the people they affect.

""I really care about helping people and mental health"" - well, mental health these days is often directly tied to financial security. Yes, you could go back and major in psychology, and become yet another grad student and release yet another set of studies: ""Study shows millennials are more anxious and less rich than their parents"".  ""Study shows having a good job is way better than not having one."" ""Study shows millennials actually want children, but can't afford them.""

Or you could get good at software development and management and learn to run a business, then open your own software consultancy, offering jobs with good salaries and PTO and pregnancy leave. Are you ""changing the world""? No, but you could at least offer stable employment and the resulting mental health benefits to potentially hundreds of people. 

Anyway, hopefully you get my drift - software doesn't have to mean grinding meaninglessly for Meta. I don't LOVE MY JOB, but the big ol' boring non-tech insurance company I work for treats its workers and customers very well, as far as I can tell, and that makes a difference.

The work we did contributed ultimately to energy production, oil extraction, oil discovery, fracking, refinery optimisation, and a million other optimisation roles as well as predictive maintenance.

Am I happy I contributed to that? No. But the impact of our work was very high levels of increased safety, reduced emissions, reduced material usage, better use of existing materials, etc.

5,cscareerquestions,Have any of you moved from US to Europe as a software developer? How was your experience?,iy7qqhm,"I'm not exactly who you're looking for, since I worked for a year as a mechanical engineer in the US before moving to Germany to do my Master's degree and have been working as a software engineer for the past year.

Salary-wise it would probably be a huge cut for you. I started at 50k€, which was raised to 60k€ after 6 months. Starting January I'll earn 78k€, and recently rejected a job offer for 74k€. This actually really suprised me though, because it's much higher than everywhere I've read for 1 year of experience, but I think it depends on the industry and type of company. [Here's](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/) a good write-up of salaries in Europe. With 4 years of experience, I'd expect you'd earn anywhere from 70k-100k in Germany.

The cost of living is lower though, and with 60k€, I can afford to rent a nice 645 square foot flat in the center of the second biggest city in Germany, but luxury items are the same price, or more expensive, so your buying power is probably considerably lower. It's hard for me to have a perspective on this, since I never earned a 'software engineering' salary in the US. You should also factor in that you'll be taxed 40% (albeit, this includes healthcare).

Work life balance is significantly better. Where I was getting two weeks of vacation in the US, I'm immediately getting 6 weeks in Germany (as well as an average of 5 holidays). Overtime is always compensated, although generally in time off (and I rarely work more than 40 hours anyway). The bar for taking sick days is considerably lower, although I still felt guilty the one time I had to take one.

As a software engineer, the difference in social benefits is not noticeable. Besides the monthly healthcare contributions, you pay nothing or very little for healthcare but it probably doesn't make up for the difference in salary.

Overall I'm quite happy with my move. I value the extra time off and the ability to easily travel within Europe more than any salary, the city I live in is extremely safe, with even less well off areas being well maintained with parks and public services, and it's way more walkable than any US city outside of NYC. But it's also not for everyone. Like another poster said, you've basically got to uproot your entire life in the US and try to rebuild it in Europe. Despite being fluent in German, most of my friends are internationals that I met through University. It's always hard to make friends as an adult, but Germans/Northern Europeans tend to be more closed off and introverted than other cultures. While apartments are cheaper, there's also a significant lack of them, and it can be hard to find a place to live in the area you want without knowing someone. Also generally day to day annoyances can begin to eat at you, like dealing with bureaucracy, businesses insisting you pay with cash (either because they only accept cash, or their card reader hasn't been working for an entire freaking week in a branch of a popular supermarket chain which they're not pressured to fix because they assume everyone has cash on them or a specific type of credit card you can only get in germany), etc. The post is getting a bit long so I'll end it here, but if you have any questions you can feel free to ask.",MeanPangolin6,,False,t3_z7k1kj,t3_z7k1kj,False,33,11-29-2022,0.9897,16.0

5,cscareerquestions,Have any of you moved from US to Europe as a software developer? How was your experience?,iy8zabi,"Western Europe and North America (Canada and the us) shares many similarities but when you zoom in you’ll notice that the work culture is fundamentally different.

In the us and Canada if you’re a go getter and motivated enough you’ll make big money (in the US more than Canada, but the mindset is very similar). This will come at the cost of any work life balance.
In Western Europe you’ll meet a glass ceiling and chasing money in the same way won’t pay off.

At the same time, Europeans enjoy a better social safety net and overall an healthier lifestyle, including cheaper public transportation and more options for outdoor activities.

Also, in Europe they give way more importance to degrees and certifications. A MSc is pretty much expected, whereas in North America many people start working with a BSc.

In conclusion, It comes down to how much you value financial gains over other aspects of life. But be aware that the tech industry in North America is the exception, not the rule.

Find problems and work on solving them. Talk to your team mates. Talk to other teams. Talk to your team's internal customers. Find problems. Collect a bunch and make a list. But don't make any commitments. Tell them you're just learning. Don't even say you're going to work on them. Commitments are above your pay grade. 

If it wasn't your first job, I'd say just start working on them after completing your assigned work, but since it is your first job, share the list with your boss. Tell them you want to work on these things since you're out of assigned work, but you need help determining priority. After priority is sorted, ask whom you can ask for code reviews. Do this explicitly, so as to make sure you don't come off as trying to be a cowboy or something. 

There are a few ways this can go wrong, so you should be prepared for them. 

* Other teams and internal customers may be confused by a junior initiating these conversations. You'll have to decide if this is a good idea based on the company culture. If it's not a good idea, ask a senior member or your manager for an introduction (after stating your intended plan).
* Your boss may see this as a threat, again, depending on the company culture. If that is the case, don't do any of this. 
* There's a high possibility you may not understand some of the things folks tell you. This is actually ideal. Ask for clarification from others both on and off your team. Document stuff for the next new hire.
* There's also a high possibility that most tasks won't be possible for you to do alone. Track them and do still share them with the boss, but keep them separate from the list of things you can solo. 
* People may push you to work on things or make commitments as soon as they start talking about their problems. Don't succumb to their demands. Say you can't make decisions or commitments. Be adamant. 
* You'll likely be intimidated by other teams. This is okay and normal, but don't let them push you around. They're still human. They went through the same shit you're going through now. 
* You will get any estimates about any level of effort completely wrong, so don't do it. Use your inexperience as a shield.

The fact that he is lying to you in writing is a very toxic sign of things happening behind the scenes.  The problem with bringing this up to HR is that they often ""fix the problem"" which may mean getting rid of you, so up to you if you want to approach them.  I don't think they will fire you but it is always a risk.  You can just work on your skills and look for another job in the meantime while on the clock.  I don't think you are in any immediate danger of getting fired, as always document everything.  In this case show how little work he has given and how you asked for more.  That way you can show HR later if he trys to get you fired for lack of productivity.

On the more positive side.  People that act like this are generally not looked upon favorably by Mgmt or HR.   If you make yourself familiar with the code base and work with HR/MGMT they may be looking to get rid of this guy that is a thorn in their side.

What are your current tasks that you're burning through quickly? If applicable, are you writing new/updating existing unit tests for them?

Are you introducing any new features/functionality that you can document?

Is there an onboarding document you can update/create?

Does your team have a backlog you can cherry pick from?

What's the frequency of your 1:1 meetings with your manager? With your mentor?

Some of this can be viewed as busy work, but it can help you keep a schedule, build experience, and pad your resume. On top of this, I think I saw another person(s) comment it too, document everything that's a roadblock for you on any of it that's applicable to your position.

For example:

7:00: Wake up, do your morning routine.

8:00: grind LeetCode for 45 minutes.

8:45-9:00: Shift gears to work mode

9:00: Daily standup, check emails/group messages and DMs, whatever your first 15-30 minutes of work is.

9:15/9:30: start any new/resume in progress tasks

12:00: lunch

12:30/13:00: back to work. Any tasks (feature code, unit tests, updating tickets, etc.) left? No, read/update internal documentation or create new unit tests that add value or just study the existing ones, if there are any.

15:00: 1:1 meeting with your manager. If your manager doesn't cancel, professionally express what you're working on to familiarize yourself with the documentation, code base, and how you think your career trajectory is with your current role (learning enough proprietary or stackwise) and for any help you think you need for it. If your manager cancels, they cancel. Regardless, document it all; what you did cover and their responses, or what you didn't get to cover and that the meeting was canceled and when it was canceled.

15:30-when you're done, 17:00? 17:30? 18:00: more tickets/tasks requiring feature code, unit tests, and/or documentation. If you're feeling brazen, grind LeetCode or do more online training that's not proprietary.


Obviously this example doesn't contain any meetings, but can be used to pad your resume with tickets/feature work, unit tests, and writing documentation.

If 1-3 months of this keeps up, then go above their head to their manager, requesting that a member of HR be present if you feel you need a witness that's not in your reporting branch. If that doesn't get you anywhere in that team, request a transfer to a new team. If you don't feel like investing that time and/or you can't get transferred to a different team, abandon ship.",redcc-0099,,False,t3_xt6yid,t1_iqp5c98,False,7,10-02-2022,0.9188,5.0

10,cscareerquestions,Does Software Development really require relearning new languages every few years? Ageism?,c50c4ld,"CS Senior next fall so take with a grain of salt.

There's a constant barrage of new languages but there's a couple core languages which seem to have staying power, specifically I have in mind: Java and C/C++. While there are many new languages being developed much of the functionality can be emulated in these, and other, 'core' languages through frameworks.

Also language change doesn't happen over night, you'll have time to learn any new language which truly explodes while on the job. And businesses rarely drop their legacy projects for the latest new thing.

Finally once you've got a handle on the concepts of programming, OO, functional, procedural, data structures, new languages come much easier since the changes are largely connected to the syntax of a language.

Hope my wall of text helps.

TLDR; Change doesn't happen over night and understanding core concepts makes adopting new languages much less painful.

6) Visual Basic - 21y

I only listed the ones that were older than 20 years. *None* of the top 20 were created in the last decade.


The things you really need to understand are that a) new languages are often based on existing languages b) new languages are far easier to pick up then you imagine and c) there are many, many software design concepts that extend beyond *all languages*.

Your story sounds a lot like mine. I went to high school right after the dot-com bubble. I loved programming but my family was convinced there was no future in it. My dad would tell me that when he was my age, everyone studied drafting (on paper), which ended up being a completely useless skill (I suppose because of CAD.... ironically enough I did this at one point) and all those people studying it were ruining their lives. Somehow this was supposed to be analogous to computer science and he really didn't want me studying it.

I decided to do the closest thing instead and I doubled in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I found the material very interesting, but I never lost the passion for programming. I tried a co-op in substation engineering, but I knew I couldn't do it for 40 years. By the time I graduated I just decided to do programming anyway. My lack of CS degree bit me. I tried to get into development, but got stuck in testing job for a while and couldn't get out. I eventually got into development, but it wasn't as easy as I expected.

My advice is to do what you love. No one can predict where an industry is going in several decades.

10,cscareerquestions,Does Software Development really require relearning new languages every few years? Ageism?,c50fvlu,"I wouldnt say re-learning a new language every few years is accurate. With a few exceptions most of what everyone is raving about today is 10 years old or older (Java, Haskell, Lisp, Scheme, C, C++, etc) Industry moves slow when it comes to new technologies such as new languages. So you'll see that on the horizon and pick things up even if you dont put real effort into learning right away.

Something that should be corrected right here though - School is NEVER a place to learn ANYTHING to fluency. Your standard CS program will have a small sprinkling of introductory courses in programming usually with different languages throughout.  So don't ever count on learning anything to fluency in an undergrad curriculum. It just wont happen.

That being said; learning a new language really is just learning syntax. Having learned C back in the 90's and PHP in the early 2000's and later Java, picking up Python took about 2 weeks. I learned PowerShell in about a week. C# took a little while about 3-4 weeks, only because of learning interfaces and libraries. The syntax was really down in a few hours. I'm re-learning C since I've never done anything with it in a while and I'm finding that C is very easy to pickup and understand only 2 weeks into learning. 

Proficiency or ""fluency"" is just honed skill or practice. And as you'll learn once you get out of college, you'll be introduced to things on virtually every project that you've never seen before, so each project you'll be learning something new.

10,cscareerquestions,Does Software Development really require relearning new languages every few years? Ageism?,c50g8zw,"New languages don't come along _that_ often.  And paradigms (i.e. ways of thinking about programming) come along even less.  So it's not _that_ bad.  But if you also include language improvements / new libraries / new frameworks - then yes it's a lot.  But really, you don't need to know everything, just enough to get the job done in a competitive way.  

The important thing though, is that the new stuff is driven by experienced guys spotting an opportunity to get the job done faster / cheaper / with less hassle / with more robustness.  If no release had ever been an improvement we'd all still be churning out some language from the late 60's.

But my point is that after 5 - 7 years you'll be on your way to _being_ _one_ _of_ _those_ _guys_.  New stuff won't be a chore - you'll spot that it means a happier client, and more solid project, better returns.  If you stay junior, then sure, some day someone's gonna dump a big book on your desk and say ""next project's in -blah-, learn it!"".  But if you're as passionate as you say, you'll honestly be the guy saying ""hey! let's use this - it's better"".  Or, maybe crucially, you'll be the guy who can have the insight to say ""no, we don't need -blah-, it's a fad; job's easier to do in C++ / PHP, whatever we're currently using"".

Programming on the conceptual level doesn't change that much, maybe less than your dad's job.

10,cscareerquestions,Does Software Development really require relearning new languages every few years? Ageism?,c50c7i2,"Learning a new language is just syntax. Learning a new programming paradigm may take some effort (like going from imperative to functional), but if you already know one language in the same paradigm learning another should not take very long. For instance, if you know Java, picking up C#, Python, etc, should very easy. If you had to learn Haskell that might be a little harder, but you're still programming.

In college you should be learning 5-6 different languages anyway, so I don't see why this is such a big deal. 

I guarantee that your dad has gone through some paradigm changes in electrical engineering in the past two decades, so I don't think that's a great example. Any career where you will be a knowledge worker is going to involve learning new things. Do you think doctors and lawyers never learn a thing after getting their degrees?

I'm also not sure why you think you will lose passion for something just because you've been doing it for 20 years.

I can code and it's fun to do my own projects but I can easily get stuck and stall out which really hurt my pace.  If I was in an environment with hostile co-workers (ie: coworkers who don't understand that you need to help your junior devs and get all shitty when you ask questions) I could stall out indefinitely because my anxiety would stop me from wanting to engage with them.

When I entered the work force full time though I started as QA instead and it has been a fantastic fit for me.  My programming and other computer experience has helped me a ton too, I can understand what devs are talking about and identify potential risks and links in ways I wouldn't have been able to if I didn't have it.

As a warning though, many devs don't like this path and will criticize you (and me!) for even considering it.

12,cscareerquestions,"Fired again due to poor performance, now what? Alternative career paths for bad software developers",iu2yjj4,"Have experienced the same awakening of finding out that even as a software engineer/dev at my current company, I actually don’t spend a lot of time coding. I still code maybe a couple hours a day but then I’m in meetings, talking about the product with the product team, chatting to designers, sitting in on dev ops team meetings and even taken part in the design of new remote server systems. What I’ve realised is that you’re really hired as problem solver, sure a problem solver who can code, but depending on your role and the company, you can be coding for 6 hours a day or 1 hour a day, and that can change depending on a bunch of shit like product lifecycle stages, sprint progress etc etc. I’m obviously preaching to the choir here as I’m sure the bloke in replying to can relate to what I’m saying. But what actually made me an attractive hire was that I can code above average (but not better than some other engineers in my company) butttt, I can communicate clearly, I have experience and skills in dev ops and I get along with everyone. 

Hell, getting a long with people and just being nice and likeable, listening to what managers have to say and overall being a good person has made me more successful in my career than I’d say anything else. Even though software engineering is more objective in practice than a lot of other industries, you’ll never be able to escape the fact that people are people and you can make it far in the world by being a team player.

So prior to this job, I had a 6 month jr dev contract and did not fulfil 80% of the listed requirements. What I did was network in all the places seniors network or learn (for example FSecure has a CISSP mentorship program that’s free. I got 3 interviews from that alone and one led to this job.) Once I got the interview, I did a “recon” project on the target company using free, legal means and that was enough to convince them that even with the knowledge gaps, I can learn it. Esp since I discovered a lot of vulnerabilities from that alone + endpoints that should not have been public.

So for me, it was about 

1. Getting a strong referral from someone in a technical leadership position so I never had to apply to any of my interviews or do the phone screen with HR who is just robotically checking a list 

2. Value validation project showing ability to learn fast +eagerness/passion

That said, Im not a senior here. Just not the most junior. Not sure how much you’re making but my role is low six fig if you’re willing to start here. Promotions happen very fast. I know someone with 1YOE as a security engineer who just got a lead sec eng position at 150k.

12,cscareerquestions,"Fired again due to poor performance, now what? Alternative career paths for bad software developers",iu0znzq,"I've known a lot of engineers who know their stuff, but do a bad job of explaining things because they don't know their audience. They just throw a bunch of facts at their audience without any consideration for what they already know, what they care about, or what they're trying to do with the information. They turn on a firehose of information without any sort of context, and their audience gets hopefully lost.

The best explanations start with making sure everyone is on the same page about what you're trying to do and why, and then getting into details once everyone has a framework to fit them into. And you occasionally need to come back up for air and give examples to tie things back to the high level context, so you don't lose people.

I work in adtech and recently had to present our service architecture to a group of strangers, and I started off with something like:


That summary could fit literally every single adtech company's service architecture, so it wasn't anything new to the people I was presenting to. But just touching on the big picture really quickly made it really easy for them to figure out approximately how each service fit in, whereas if I immediately started diving into code on one particular service, they would have had to guess at how it fit with the rest.

Similarly, when I'm asking someone to explain something to me, I try to let them know which parts of the big picture I have and which ones I'm missing, to make it easy for them to tailor their explanation to my needs. My questions usually look like ""How does X work? I ask because I'm trying to do Y, and I'm pretty sure X is the only piece I'm missing."" In the past I've had a lot of experiences where I asked a very specific question without that context, got a very specific answer, and then wasted a lot of time before finding out that I was going the wrong direction entirely, and the person I asked could have seen that if I gave them the bigger picture.

In general, take a step back and make sure everyone involved knows why you're communicating before one of you starts infodumping, and you can save a lot of trouble for everyone involved.

12,cscareerquestions,"Fired again due to poor performance, now what? Alternative career paths for bad software developers",iu0kuxf,"Along with grammar and tone that other people are talking about, good communication balances other people's time, focus, need to know, and their role and responsibility.

If you're writing something *or forwarding something else wrote* for a customer, you have to set reasonable expectations without sounding overly pessimistic.  Don't over-promise (Sales will do that for you), and don't air the smelly laundry (e.g. ""I doubt we'll get that finished any time soon.  That area of the code is a mess."").  If there is any doubt, *have someone appropriate proof-read* before you send.  And ""customer"" can mean people from other teams depending on the output of your team's work.

If you're communicating with a senior-to-you developer or even someone with more domain knowledge on a different team, always keep in mind that their time is precious and interruptions disrupt focus and productivity.

* DO reach out for help before going too far down the rabbit hole if it's going to affect your ability to deliver your work.

* DON'T reach out for help without reading the documentation / googling shit first.

* DO make sure the first line of any communication concisely conveys the important bits, so that readers can easily make the ""do I need to pay attention to this now/later/at all"" judgement easily.

Finally, in today's multi-cultural environment, it's more important than ever to **try and communicate with people in a culturally-appropriate way**.  Unfortunately, this isn't at all simple.  Even the old ""always be 'professional'"" is outdated.  Some people feel like too much formality is being cold and unfriendly or even talking down to them.

12,cscareerquestions,"Fired again due to poor performance, now what? Alternative career paths for bad software developers",iu27ufu,"Which again, often comes down to communication.  It's totally normal for a junior to get thrown a ticket they're in over their head on.

A common mistake juniors make is to assume there's something wrong with them when they can't immediately get to grips with something like convoluted legacy code.  They flail around with the problem until it's late and maybe then get help from someone. At this point they're panicked, their lead is annoyed, and whoever has been roped into helping junior with their work problem is also annoyed and has to take on junior's panic.

An effective junior spends a short amount of time getting to grips with the problem, and upon realizing that they have no clear idea of how to proceed promptly schedules a meeting with someone that can help them.  Spending 30 scheduled minutes on Tuesday talking a junior through something you wrote 3 years ago is a lot less frustrating than dealing with their crisis at 2PM on a Friday.  An effective junior also manages their lead's expectations by communicating that they're struggling with the ticket in the next morning's standup.  This lets the lead know the ticket may be late and helps them suggest who can help the junior get over the roadblock.

There's the struggling junior that manages expectations and solicits effective mentorship from more senior devs, and the struggling junior that tries to be invisible in the corner like a sick animal.  The junior that comes into the company and just crushes everything they get handed?

Normally, most people expect you to say ""hi"" in some form before blurting out some question. *Especially* non-engineer types. Yes, it's technically inefficient. But we aren't robots.

I'm *personally* completely indifferent to whether I get a ""Hello"" before being asked a question. Most people would rather get a ""Hello"" first, depending on how busy they are and how often you talk to them. But also, you only need to give one ""Hello"" per person per day.

But if your question is relatively high priority/you're blocked without an answer, after waiting a reasonable amount of time(how long depends on severity/priority), go ahead and ask your question.

If *production is down* and this person is the one you think can help, sure, don't bother with the formality of ""hi"".

Also, if you've never talked to this person, literally ""Hey."" is a bit blunt for your first hello. ""Hi Steve."" ""Hey Mark, how's it going?"" Followed by ""(""Going good/okay"", assuming they asked you how you're doing). I'm working on X, and..."" or something like that.

These things only apply to one on one communication via direct chat messages. If you're talking to a channel or multiple people, or sending an email, get to the point and immediately provide useful information and context about what you're asking without writing a novel. It's like approaching somebody's desk vs addressing a room or leaving a note.

Also, keep track of how people initiate conversations with *you*. If they frequently get straight to the point without saying ""hi"", respond in kind when initiating dialogue with that person.",darthfodder,,False,t3_yeihid,t1_itzzbnm,1666914425.0,1,10-27-2022,0.966,10.0

 Although  I am told to bring my “authentic self” to work though…. Well, sorta lol. 

There are levels to this game for example- 

Other than my occasional abhorrent vernacular, I once shared what I did over the weekend during a team meeting. I am a bow hunter and just got back from a two  day hunting trip. I was promptly called a murderer in front of everyone present at the stand up. 

The lead interrupted me and said, “Bambi murdering aside, what did everyone else do this weekend?”

Super infuriating. Very condescending. 

Living literally in the middle of nowhere, it’s how we get the majority of our meat for the winter. Roads up here are impassable at times in the mountains.

13,cscareerquestions,Good at LC but bad at software development l,ix5jpkm,"Welcome to the realization that being good at leetcode does not make someone a good developer.


Software development *is* problem solving. The issue as a junior is you have next to no understanding of the underlying business and how everything connects together. You just have to learn as you go and try your best to keep up. The expectation is that you ""learned how to learn"" so to speak, and have enough foundational understanding of programming to be able to learn the rest on your own/with the help of mentors.

Unless you are some type of prodigy, juniors are almost always going to be a net drain on the team they join. Not only are they going to be unable to keep up and contribute to the same extent more tenured team members are, those same senior team members have to spend more of their time helping you ramp up. That is also part of their job description and it is expected for them to do that, so don't feel like you are wasting their time. 

To keep from actually wasting their time however, make sure you learn to ask *good* questions, and try your best to never ask the same question twice without good reason. Whether you need to take notes or whatever else, find what works for you.

I am at midlevel, but here is what helped me the most so far.
- Understand business problems and then technical problems You are trying to solve. 
- oftentimes, you will see code that works but doesn't make total sense. Always investigate the  ""why"" behind everything. 
- Get better at searching things - This involves previous code committed, internal documentation, Google, framework documentation, etc. If you ask the right question to Google, you would most likely find the answer. You may need to tweak your keywords a little bit. 
From time to time, it's always a good idea to take crash courses to learn high-level knowledge of  new language, framework / tool you encounter.

It doesn't really matter what the problem you're solving is, so long as you're the one making the design decisions.

When you're maintaining it, you'll quickly notice that your initial design decisions *sucked* \- your code will be hard to maintain, hard to understand when you pick it up again, and contain undocumented assumptions that turned out to be wrong.

More importantly, you'll understand first-hand why your design choices sucked, and actually be able to internalize the lessons involved. You can't really learn design by reading about it or seeing examples, unless you have your own experiences to map those lessons onto. You have to make choices, feel the consequences of those choices, and iterate based on them.

It comes with time, and the only people who are good at it out of Uni have already been doing it in other contexts.

It took time to readjust myself.

You'll see with time that there's crossover. For software development, the crossover is in using your knowledge of CS to reason about what you're doing in a more abstract way.

You can think of UI interactions/work flows as graphs and state machines, for example. This helps with debugging/root cause analysis/reasoning about correctness.

SE in general is 80% glue. Another term is ""boilerplate"".

But that glue still needs to be understood and reasoned about. 

You want to be able to think about the things you don't have control over; a good example is how concurrency is defined and configured in an underlying library or framework.

If you have time, it wouldn't hurt to learn more about the internals of what you're using.

* Can you make 'debugging API calls' more efficient? It's worth it to invest the time in setting up a good test environment or learning different tools.
* What more can you do to unblock yourself? Are you waiting a long time before asking for help? Is the lack of understanding of the framework holding you back?

When I joined my first SWE job, I felt like an impostor. Partially syndrome and partially reality - I just had a lot to learn. To combat this, I spent extra time to get grounded and learn the fundamentals, everything from something as general as git to domain specific stuff to my team. IMO pretty much everything in your career builds off early fundamentals.

Fast forward a couple years - I’m working 25-35 hours a week. I feel much more competent as SWE, as opposed to when I started, where I felt absolutely clueless. Even in a 20 hour week, I’m able to do productive work, whereas when I started, those 60 hour weeks were often learning focused and had no deliverable outcome. But that early grind helped my learning and ultimately set up getting to this stage (and hopefully continued sub 40 hour weeks :) )

I think the key point is that the extra hours were my decision, much like working less hours (as long as I get my work done) now is my decision.

14,cscareerquestions,Is it normal for a new software developer to work 50+ hours a week in the beginning?,ipser4d,"Fortunately, this sounds like no one is actually requiring you to work 50+ hours. If you're dealing with multiple product managers, there are two very important things to keep in mind:  

1) they're not your boss. You can, with proper tact, tell them that you cannot deliver what they want you to deliver. They can't fire you.   

2) They don't know what other product managers are asking you to do, and it's your job to learn how to communicate that.  

Pro tip: give preference (in your own head) for work priority to the product managers that communicate well and work with you to get things done, not the ones who drop things in your lap and then complain loudly.  

Just give your engineering manager a heads up if you get one of the latter types so they know to ignore them. It's tempting to take advantage of the more reasonable PMs by delaying their work. Don't do it. Make them your allies and establish boundaries with the bad ones so they understand that they have to work with you, not shout at you.  

All this takes practice, but it's best to start by scaling back your hours to something more reasonable, then using 1 on 1s with your engineering manager to work out how to deal with too much work being assigned if you can't keep up.

I have [gone through a similar situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jjmu5i/what_does_a_competent_professional_do_when/gaiyp3q/). What helped was four things:

1. Naming the emotion I was feeling: fear. Literally saying to myself in my journal ""I am feeling fear"" created some mental clarity.

2. Starting a 3-person group that regularly had tea/beer together at 5pm and socialized, talking occasionally about work but in more general terms. The other two engineers in that group were more senior than I.

3. Being clear that I needed a to talk through problems with engineer. I did this with a test engineer (who was grateful for the career experience) and with another engineer at the same level as me. We got into a rhythm of doing our own version of pair programming with the pomodoro technique. This usually started with us both typing into a google doc to collaboratively list out the questions that we were worried about.

4. Being very grateful for people's help, in specific terms. [According to neurobiology professor Andrew Huberman, hearing someone else's sincere gratitude helps a person's mental health and sense of social belonging](https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-gratitude-and-how-to-build-a-gratitude-practice/).

16,cscareerquestions,Help! I am an incompetent software developer and I want to change.,iydmnxz,"Here's how a senior engineer might approach a relatively large project that has lots of pieces they're uncertain about:

First, write down the different pieces that need to be done. Maybe if you had to build an entire website from scratch for a client, you'd have a 5-10 page doc (depending on project scope) that outlines everything. ""We need a database, backups for that database, a web server, and a web client. Database will be MySQL and needs these tables. Web server will be written in Java and needs these pages and API endpoints. Web client will be React and Tailwind and is relatively straightforward.""

Then you'd show this to someone who has done this kinda work before. ""Hey, am I missing anything?"" And they'll look and say, ""Oh yeah, you're missing all of the AWS stuff you'll need to do. You'll need to have something in place for deploying and updating the app."" Iterate until more senior people think this looks good.

Then look at the pieces they're not sure about, and they'd track people down. ""Hey, you do a lot of work with databases. How do we set up databases for new clients? How do we do backups?"" Then go to the next person. ""Hey, you do a lot of AWS stuff, how do we set up stuff for clients on AWS? Is there a recent example I can look at?""

Then break it into a linear series of tasks and go through the tasks. Keep the tasks small-to-medium sized. Don't dump too much at once. Keep asking questions. When you get stuck, ask more questions. Always make progress.

-	you could go back to a slower-paced, more “boring” position like the defense work. Government jobs, old companies, hardware companies.
-	you could switch specialties so you can get beginner type work again
-	you could keep company hopping, filtering for companies that have positive management reputations (safety to fail, mentorship, etc) and working on these skills in therapy, and hoping the small gains will keep racking up.
-	you could do contracting work where you aren’t being compared directly to other engineers
-	depending on your non-programming skills, you could pick another role at the companies you’re into. Engineering managers often don’t code at all.

You should go to smaller companies, non-tech primarily. Tech workers are not always the smartest of the smart, you probably did too well in your interview and set your sights too high. Go smaller and less cutthroat tech.

Also, have you tried other stacks? If, say, you've only done backend, try some frontend and see if you'd be faster at it, or the reverse. They require slightly different skills, and maybe your learning approach fits better with a different stack.

* 1 year as a low performer on a team with really good devs. This is likely an anomaly. You now have the equivalent of 1 year experience + an internship (though for hiring purposes should definitely market it as 3)

Now the teammates you've compared yourself to, how much experience do they have, *really*? Lots of people graduate, but have been programming for years and have maybe even been contributing to open source long before graduation. Obviously, those people may be better (according to you, ""smarter"") than you. But those aren't really fair comparisons either.

What about comparing yourself to a former colleague from the defense contractor, with the same amount of on-paper experience as you, but who stayed there and continued coasting? I'd wager there's a good chance if you were able to compare yourself to such a person, you'd find you're actually more talented than them at this point in your career.

I don't think you necessarily *need* to be a rock-star either. From the sound of it, you're going above and beyond, and I think it's likely that with this dedication, you'd find yourself being the person the team comes to in a future job.

All that being said, I think you ***absolutely*** should stick with it. You actually *enjoy* software, and even if, in the worst case scenario, you're destined to be in the bottom 20% of software devs indefinitely, there are jobs for those people, and you can still make an amount of money at the 20th percentile software salary (which realistically should be *more* than 20th percentile once you have experience) that people in most other fields would be jealous of.

One last thing I really want you to hear is that there's so much more that comes with experience than writing code, or writing clean code. With experience, you'll be more capable of reasoning about systems from a high level, even if you struggle with the implementation, than even the most talented entry-level people (and the most talented entry-level people might clear 200K in salary), so there's a place for you on a team somewhere, and if it's at a discount to the market rate for software devs, because you can't do LC hards, there will be teams that will consider themselves lucky to have you still",AintNothinbutaGFring,,False,t3_yb0z01,t3_yb0z01,False,2,10-23-2022,0.9938,27.0

1. Read as much code as you can and try to really understand what it's doing. Make the most of your team's PR process, use this tool to converse about code with your team. Always read others' code and understand what they're doing and why, and maybe how it could be better. You'll start to see patterns which you can reuse and improve in your own code. Negative feedback is the most useful kind of feedback so don't shy away from being wrong or getting criticized.
2. Really dive into the issue and research any time you get stuck. From your post it seems like it's a common pattern that you rely too quickly on asking for your team's help, which is fine when you're really stuck or you don't have certain domain knowledge, but really you should be doing everything you can to ""unstuck"" yourself. In most cases, the issue you've encountered or the thing you're trying to implement has a general pattern that can be found online in articles, tech blogs, stackoverflow. Don't be afraid to try a lot of different solutions and optimize it in your own way/use case. You'll learn a lot doing this and one of the best things about coding, as you prob know, is that you can fuck up as many times as you want. You can compile and re-compile as many times as you want until it works, which is personally what I love about software dev - this is a unique aspect that you can't find in most careers.

Ok, now where do your issues lie? Well... it could be of many different factors. You could be in a field where you aren't really interested in. That will cause a lack of motivation. You know that basics but haven't learned how to tie them together with more complex concepts.

You could not have the problem solving experience. If this is the case, work on personal projects that challenge your abilities. If you can make the project without struggling then you aren't challenging yourself enough. You should be trying to learn new concepts or try learning new ways to do something you already know how to do (i.e. practice using recursion instead of loops or something like that. Loops are a big hindering for performance and should really be used when needed).

You could spend time on leetcode but I personally find that to be very tiring and repetitive. It's like brute forcing yourself to learn different ideas, a lot of which you will never need or use. If you do go this route, look for questions related to your field of choice. 

I don't know your field of employment, but you could just not really be interested in what your actually doing. I love programming but hated web development. It wasn't until I switched to 3d graphics that I really found my love for programming.

You could also just have had bad teachers. If this is the case, find yourself a mentor, in the field of your choise, and pick their brains. Ask them for help or advice in the areas your struggling. There may be simple tricks that you were never taught or shown.

Whatever the reason may be, it's not because your stupid. Comparing yourself to others will only make you hate this being a software engineer. There will ALWAYS be better developers then you, no matter how great you become. The only person you should ever compare yourself to is the person you were yesterday.

If you wake up a better or smarter person then you woke up the day before, no matter how small the change is, you will be 1 step closer to your success.

You do not know another person's background. You could be comparing yourself to someone who's been exposed to software since their birth. It's extremely hard to compete with someone who's been digging in code since they were a child.

First of all code interviews are an absolute bs and the clowns running them have no idea what they are doing, what they are measuring and how to interprete the results. 

Whiteboarding is the most useless tool to measure technical/problem solving skills and culture fit and it's silently costing companies billions of dollars in lost resources and bad hires. 

I took at least a dozen of these interviews and failed every single one of them. 

Most of the teams I faced in the interviews had members I bet would not hire each other if they had the opportunity to run interviews among themselves.

So one day I said enough of this bs and would not take any more requests for interviews if they included whiteboarding, I would tell the recruiters right away, many would never call or email again. 

But a few actually invited me over to interview and I had a great experience in a complete different environment where I had the opportunity to work on real projects and design systems, instead of writing a kd tree algorithm from memory. 

Some of these interviews landed offers and I went to pursue a very fulfilling career working with very smart people, many from ivy league schools, solving interesting and important problems (and learning a lot!)

I was always praised both by managers and team members alike in team building sessions and performance reviews. 

And I was not among the smartest or the fastest of the bunch by any means. 

But I believe I had other skills that made me likeable and dependable for my team members and managers and I guess I was also very lucky to be part of a great culture in some of the companies I worked for.

I learned that if you give people the right environment, tools and opportunities to grow they will often surprise you. 

And that stayed with me until today when I run my own small business. 

Companies usually don't need a team full of star developers spitting out code like a printer, particularly when chances of a new product feature making it into production is relatively low. 

It seems to me you were just working at a place with a terrible culture with ""leaders"" that instead trying to help you develop into a great team player kept comparing you to a bs baseline set by their star developers, again like the whiteboarding squat, no clue about what they are doing. 

You are not the start developer, big deal, you have other soft skills a star developer may not necessarily have that are also essential for a any business to succeed. 

I currently lead teams of developers where we probably have 2-3 star developers leading the way in a team of 15-20 at a given time. 

Solving problems and writing code fast is not the most important thing for us, there are of course reasonable time limits for each problem to be solved, but speed is not our main metric. 

Our quarterly team's feedback is. 

A good culture and non toxic work environment where everyone feels valued, respected and motivated to build cool stuff is what keep us delivering quality software and getting much more request for work than we can handle.

I worked at a shit, totally unmotivated company full of incompetent people for two years, and hated it and was bored, but it paid the bills and as long as I delivered like one small task a month no one was mad at me. It did eat my soul a bit though. My current place is terrifyingly full of competent people… but also has a really supportive culture and a lot of really supportive managers. I’ve had moments of what feel like intense failures here, due to ADHD/anxiety/especially working from home all the time when lockdowns hit, and also just due to my own mistakes. But they were within the boundaries of what I could weather and learn from without quitting from sheer shame, and I’m still here. Even though I still have weeks when I just can’t focus, I’m “smarter” than ever. It’s become really really clear that I just have slightly different skills than many others on my team. 

Also, side note: medicating my ADHD made a significant difference for me, but it would not have been so significant if I hadn’t tried different medications until I found one that did not just make a difference but actually worked *well*. If the meds worked a little bit but you’re still struggling, it’s possible you’re on the wrong med or the wrong dose.

This is your answer right here - you aren’t dumb, you just take longer to do things because your brain needs to investigate every detail of the task at hand, I’m exactly the same way and while it has it’s issues, if you are consistent enough, you will eventually have both the depth and the breadth of knowledge to be a valuable asset to the team. 

You need to find a job that fascinates you. I’m sure you’re familiar with hyper focus, if you can find a job that gets you into that state, and you can hold it down long enough to become a master, you will be set.




It sounds like you’re in a tough spot right now and I definitely empathize with your situation, so 
below I wrote a message from one person with ADHD to another, it’s rather long, so I understand if you don’t want to read it, but I hope that it helps you if you decide to.





If I might offer a different perspective on your post, I don’t think the issue is that you’re “not smart”. First of all, what you have posted here would not have been posted by a dumb person, it shows self-reflection and awareness. You organized your thoughts and conveyed them effectively. You seem like a smart person to me. Also, you have identified all sorts of weaknesses in yourself and have continued to implement mitigation strategies throughout your life and career, dumb people don’t do that either.

Frankly, I don’t even need to know any of those details, because navigating the entirety of your pre-adult life with undiagnosed ADHD, not to mention going to college, getting a goddamn masters degree, and making a career out of software development is an incredibly unlikely scenario. I know from experience that with ADHD (especially undiagnosed for so long), the odds are truly stacked against you.

My experience growing up was incredibly confusing, because I was completely different from most other people in so many different ways, but there was apparently nothing medically wrong with me. Looking back, being undiagnosed was debilitating to every aspect of my life - social, educational, vocational, recreational, etc etc. I’m super proud of myself for making it through college. It took me 7 years, but the nice thing is my degree only says the year I graduated XD.

The point is, you have overcome significant odds to get where you are today, if you aren’t familiar with them already, you should look up the stats surrounding ADHD comorbidities. This is a serious disorder, and you should be proud of yourself that you have been successful, and yes you have been successful. I too only see my weaknesses and think about them all the time, and it sounds like you are similar in that respect.

17,cscareerquestions,Should I walk away from software development?,iteii1q,"Thanks, that helps to know. I identify with what you’ve said here, but I may have smaller versions of your struggles (or more lenient management). I have a few additional thoughts though. 


I find that for me it helps to have mental boundaries of what is “mine” vs others and what I am expected to know—and it helps if this limits my work to the well-defined boundaries of a particular framework that can be tested in isolation, etc. That way you can maybe avoid needing to understand EVERYTHING.


Advocating for really modular code structures with well-defined boundaries in your org might help you do this, and also is a “senior” thing to do. If that kind of thing appeals to you, documenting and suggesting approaches to refactor like this is also genuinely is helpful eng work (easier to understand structures help others too, and “this is hard to understand” is a legitimate complaint about a design pattern). It also might help you evade a pip as an excuse “I was spending time on this not X”, though it’s risky bc there’s always a balance of not going too far outside your scope and still getting enough work done. Also it works best if you can put your money where your mouth is as far as understanding enough of the codebase to know what to refactor—it sounds like you kind of have to gain this level of understanding to do anything, though, so this type of work might actually highlight the extra work you’re doing that doesn’t show up on your feature work. And coming up with guidelines to help others refactor counts too.


Next is documenting the level of understanding you do end up having to understand for each ticket. This is valuable, both for yourself so you can understand it quicker next time, and for new hire onboarding. Producing this type of documentation also falls under “senior” type work because it helps others + the team function smoother. What the documentation actually looks like it up to you, but think about creating something that would have helped you get what you needed to understand to do the ticket faster, and something that you can refer to in lieu of asking similar questions over and over. Often engineers develop a deep or instinctive enough understanding that they don’t feel like they need to, or even can, explain it to others, and that’s a bad thing when that knowledge needs to be shared for any reason. If you fill that gap you’ll be valuable to the team even if your code output sucks (and really you’re making documentation for yourself, so ideally it will help you get faster at tickets as well).


TDD might also help you adopt a framing of “my job is to do only this and no more” but I find that the struggle of finding WHERE in the giant codebase to put the thing never goes away until you’ve done enough major projects on your team that you yourself are the one who wrote a decent chunk of it in the first place.


If you really *need* to understand the whole thing, a contracting gig that writes small applications for various clients might be clutch for you. Obviously you will likely still be stuck with projects like expanding the thing the last dev did, but at least in that case the whole thing will be smaller, just one person’s work. Early stage startups, if you can stomach them in this environment, will also possibly be so early in the process that the codebase is still small. If it’s small enough it can fit in your head you might have a chance to grow with the codebase. That’s a bit of a scary economic prospect at the moment though.",Broad-Night,,False,t3_yb0z01,t1_ite73ca,False,8,10-23-2022,0.9967,25.0

17,cscareerquestions,Should I walk away from software development?,itik9wt,"This isn’t necessarily all on you. Yes the work means things will sometimes be ambiguous and you have to sort out what goes where, but if that’s all the time, then there is a very serious problem with your team leadership when it comes to accepting and adequately scoping work.

A few things.

1: if any manager is constantly comparing your work to others but not following up with specifics about how you might be able to improve or ways to help. That is a bad manager. A truly, very bad manager.

2. Be careful when comparing your work with others. Understand that you are comparing work output and not your value as a person.

3. If you believe your output is not as clean as others on your team, then put in the unfortunate but extra effort to look over old or current pull requests. Observe formatting and choices people make. Ex. If others make use of specific loops, or a commenting style, just copy that format. It sounds silly and might feel weird at first but that kind of stuff helps if even a little bit. If code cleanliness is important and your team doesn’t have linters put in place then add one. You can take it off the shelf so to speak and just drop it in. Linters and compilers should be hurting your feelings not your peers. This change alone can save you a decent amount of bother.

4. Try to separate you current feeling of being stupid, I don’t know you, but can almost guarantee that you absolute are not. Separate that feeling from your performance reviews or comments from others. If you take your time to understand things and tend to ask questions then fine do that up front. Think about all the kinds of questions you usually ask. Write them all down bring it up to your team as a way ti evaluate tasks. If these questions aren’t answered for a task maybe those tasks aren’t clear enough and if your team puts something like that into practice it could make communication much more streamlined. The aim is to turn what you view as a weakness into a strength. It sounds like a motivational speech but it seriously works.

17,cscareerquestions,Should I walk away from software development?,itfpo15,"Hey u/crhomere,

You sounds like me at 6YoE. It's been almost 2 years since and somehow I have crawled through that dark period. And I think you will, too.

Some thoughts from my own, similar experiences:

- You have great awareness, based on what you have been instrospecting here. I might guess that you [just lack knowledge](https://wiki.c2.com/?OrdersOfIgnorance)


- You also know how to articulate and tell stories. This is an important skill when leading at high level. It's strange but at higher level, you don't lead with raw code output but rather good domain understanding, good logic, imagination and communication skill. Notice I didn't emphasize speed, since some problems takes time.



Some tips:

- Like others said, look for a domain you want to dive deep in. You might want to find a balance between something that's difficult to master vs able to get some low hanging fruits (to show value and keep the job). Try to stick to it for 1-2 years and see if your accumulated knowledge compound.


- Some examples I can think of are: SRE, especially in monitoring and reliabity; performance (vertical perf. on single machine and distributed performance on distribited system); DevOps stuff like CI/CD, build system; manage data warehouses and pipelines, etc. These are hard, also ""dirty"" work that not many dev like to do. At the same time, it's very complex and rewarding once you understand the depths. Feel free to DM to chat as I have worked in most of them. Plus, find companies and managers that appreciate this.


- For learning the patterns faster: early on, try to seek a generalized ""map"", then zoom in into each smaller area and fill in the details. Here, an experienced mentor is going to be more helpful to you. Try asking them to teach you ""why do X instead of Y"", rather than ""how to do Y"". This will leverage your logical mind better. It is called tacit knowledge and you should read [this series on them](https://commoncog.com/tacit-knowledge-is-a-real-thing/).


- When lacking mentorship, try to read books that give overview of the domain. Skim through many and find those that teach you how to navigate many concepts. A common theme to those book for me is they talk about history of the tech, on how things evolved from simple systems to the complex state they are now.

However, a LOT of stuff that feels like “natural talent” or “high IQ” is a result of having deep knowledge of core concepts to the point that they’ve become instinctive. If you ever try to try to explain what a class is to a non-programmer you will know what I mean. Of course it’s possible this is not what’s going on but I am not sure college + 1 year of industry is a place where you’ll see “pure IQ” popping up as a differentiator over experience/environmental factors. I felt like this in college ALL the time, but what I realized in hindsight is that all those kids were already familiar with loads of coding concepts because they all took AP CS, or went to tech summer camps, or did robotics teams, so they had a lot of stuff they’d already “digested” and were fluent in. I understood things, but understanding a concept and having to be conscious about it is not the same thing as becoming so used to it that it’s instinctive.

I’m about 7 years into industry now, and I’ve acquired a lot more of that instinctive type knowledge in that time. There’s still a lot of it that I have yet to pick up, (there’s always more to learn) but at least I can see that now.

One thing I’ve done, if you have extra time, just take a look at JIRA, if you guys estimate tasks look for something worth 1 point (it varies wildly around teams, so see if you can figure out what is the number for a task around 1 or 2 days of work). You don’t need to complete it, but see what it is. Do you have any idea how to approach it? Can you find the code? The docs? If not, ask around for those things (hey what’s our main code base ? I was reading around and saw we just launched x - is there a design doc for that?)",poplex,,False,t3_y2zwkt,t3_y2zwkt,False,20,10-13-2022,0.4895,0.0

There is more to it than just installing all the programs that the (likely outdated) on boarding docs tell you to. 

The #1 thing that differentiates good sw dev from shit sw dev ime, even if both are equally good programmers: you are not a baby. The expectation is that you are actively looking to provide value with the skills you have. Don't wait for tasks to be assigned to you.  Don't be passive about what tasks are asking or how they're created. Be involved with the work you are part of. 

Explore your zshrc and see if there's any aliases commonly used in the devops repos / readmes / knowledge bases. Explore the onboarding docs of other teams, especially devops and qa and support -- they're often on the frontlines with higher turnover and will pack things into their knowledge bases that aren't available anywhere else for a remote worker.

Make sure you're able to access all the vpns and databases and repositories you'll need. 

See if there's any docker environments you can set up for development. See if there's any changes or personalizations you'd want to make to them. 

Check if you've got licenses for various bits of useful software. Even if you won't use them right away, having access to things like lens or the intellij ide's or fullstory can open up opportunities if they're available. 

Check your project management tools for tickets tagged with beginner. Ask people to get you started with them by helping you understand the specific workflows involved with bringing a ticket into your workload, notifying people you're working on it, and updating stakeholders about its progress. 

Talk to other developers and ask if you can pair program for a bit during their day. See what they work on and how. Do not be a passive participant -- engage with what they're doing. If you are using software that allows transcription, speak aloud - ""i see you are using this library to transform this data so we can access this property without interrupting a stream. I don't understand what this means so I'm going to make a note of it for later thank you.""

Start a fight in the chat app general channel over something. 

Talk to the support team and the qa team and the other project teams to get an idea of what customers like and dislike about your company and how they use the products and features you'll be involved with.

Familiarize yourself with the development environments and build processes. How do you set up a development env? How do you make changes to a live environment? How do you test your changes? 

Volunteer for things and ask for help when you get stuck. 

Be gracious and mindful of others' time when asking for help. If you have a problem you can't solve, and you've done your due diligence with searching the knowledge base, the repo, and Google, or if the problem is related to the structure of the task you're trying to complete in a way that requires domain expertise, always time box your requests.

- introduce yourself and a brief synopsis your problem

- inform them of why you're asking them (Sam said you have handled a problem like this before, please let me know if there is someone more appropriate to ask)

- specifics of your problem; repo, file, task/ticket, what you've tried, things you aren't sure of

- request for time at their convenience. Offer to schedule a 30 minute meeting so they can forget about this entirely until then. 

- come to the meeting prepared to share screen and demonstrate your problem. Record the demo if possible.

- if they solve your problem, be sure to thank them. So many people seem to think it's okay to just ""alright bye"" after receiving help ? 

- if the problem was systemic or process related, ask them if there's an appropriate document to update. If not, create one and credit them in it.",chrisrrawr,,False,t3_y2zwkt,t3_y2zwkt,False,1,10-13-2022,0.9851,21.0

Run it locally and debug too if you can hook it up with a dev environment or if you can run everything locally. Most people in the first job get overwhelmed by how big projects are, and the only way to get more familiar with the size of them and understand these projects is to read more code. 

Take a normal action in your application / system, and debug it from start to finish. Read the code more, debug some more. 

I can't stress enough how important reading and understanding code is, because you're going to be spending more of your time doing that than writing code in most cases. 

You can also look back through a previous user story / requirement that was completed, look at all the changes that were associated with it to get an idea of places in the application you'll be working. Also, read and understand the code / debug it. 

Most entry level / juniors suck for quite a while, and that's normal. The way to get better is by being able to understand the code, understand the business problems the code solves, and asking questions. The more you can learn about these things, the faster you can turn into a person that they can hand a requirement off to and not have to worry about holding your hand through the problem solving process.

If you are a typical entry level dev, all your previous jobs were part time, wage kind of stuff where a boss tells you a repetitive, mindless thing to do, and you do that mindless thing for X hours, and they give you 12x dollars at the end of the week.

In fact, I'd say it's a pretty crappy way to onboard for most people. Being handed a large codebase and having to just read through it without further direction/scoping or a project to help guide you can be overwhelming and challenging, especially for junior devs who may also not be familiar with every little thing the company/code does. Many people learn best by doing, and being given some very small project or task(s) to do can be a much more effective (and engaging/enjoyable) way to onboard. Plus it feels good to feel productive and like you're contributing.

OP: How do you like to learn? Your main goal right now is to ramp up, learn the codebase, etc. Your company doesn't expect you to be a major contributor in the first few weeks because they know you're ramping up.

This feels less than empathetic and IMO misses the mark. OP is expressing discomfort with the sense that they're not contributing, that merely reading code all day feels unproductive, and perhaps that they would prefer hands-on learning. I don't hear OP trying to overthink things or that they think they know better than their superiors. Yes, our senior level colleagues hold a lot of knowledge and expertise and I encourage OP and others to reach out to them often for assistance and guidance. But it's also true that not all experienced coders are necessarily good listeners or good mentors. Every person is different, has their own needs, and has their own preferred way of learning. We can do more to listen to our junior dev colleagues and meet them in the unique ways they need support rather than assuming we always know what's best for them.",jeremy_tokui,,False,t3_y2zwkt,t1_is5y2su,False,19,10-13-2022,0.979,19.0

I understand that - the tone of it was definitely affected by my stress and disappointment in myself for the fact that we had to fire that engineer and that I wasn't able to do more to help avoid that.  Everything I did with her was trying to be empathetic and letting her guide us toward her learning style, but that failed.  Sometimes you do need to directly communicate expectations to someone, and if someone's task is ""set your stuff up and get oriented,"" and they think they should be doing more than that, in my opinion it's fine to say ""no, you're underestimating how much work this is.  Set your stuff up and get oriented""


Yea, I'm tryina say that by assuming they _should_ be doing something else to be more productive, they're overthinking things.  There isn't anything more they should be doing other than trying to get oriented with the systems right now and learning about the organization.


I don't disagree with any of that - I'm just saying that they have been told what they should be doing, so they shouldn't be worrying about not knowing what to do.  They're assuming that there's more they should be doing, and there isn't - they've been told what to do.

I never had time for myself, my friend and family, or my hobbies. I was sleep deprived, I spent almost everyday at the hospital from 6AM to 7-9PM (not including overnight call shifts.), 80-100 hour weeks were a normal occurrence, everyone was extremely competitive, most of the time there was not prestige or appreciation just entitled or unruly rude patients, I couldn’t work out regularly, my mental and physical health were in the shitter.

Prestige doesn’t matter to me at all, doctor’s are just people you don’t have to be a doctor to have good morals no one should actively strive to hurt others. Do no harm is something everyone should strive for.

The fact that people *believe* I’m smart doesn’t matter to me in the least. Becoming a doctor isn’t difficult just like being a SWE isn’t difficult, it’s more about persistence than smarts. 

Medicine is mostly memorization and self-control in stressful situations, SWE takes more mental effort for problem solving so you could say it’s actually more difficult intellectually.

Regardless anyone who judges me for my intellect or morals can fuck right off. 

All that matters to me is being happy and healthy and enjoying life, *then* helping others.

I would disagree with the above reply somewhat and say having a math background is absolutely beneficial, especially the more you get into competitive programming (LeetCode really is just a simple / basic form of it).

There's a lot of solutions that have optimal solutions through math alone, but more than that, having a good math background means you're excellent at problem solving, and those skills are going to carry over and have a significant effect on how well you do at LeetCode.

BUT, like u/NewChameleon mentioned, you have to know the tools available to solve the problem, before you can solve the problems.

Once you understand the building blocks (which are data structures and algorithms), you can piece them together to solve LeetCode problems. And with your math background on top of that, you will do extremely well.

You can either start doing LeetCode right away and google / research everything you don't understand, or dive into an introductory DSA course first. I think the latter might give you a smoother transition, but the former is fine too.",,,False,t3_ybrrmh,t1_iti5mv4,False,3,10-23-2022,0.9501,8.0

Now, the issue with 2022 is that a lot of tech companies are requiring leetcode to get the job, and unless you are tasked with creating new APIs for an SDK, leetcode is just the wrong testing tool for so many of these cases. Engineering through a problem and leetcode are 2 very different types of skills. One tests your ability to observe a problem and solve it from start to finish (the higher level engineering mindset). The other tests your algorithmic problem solving abilities (the lower level computer science mindset).",kongker81,,False,t3_xhee8u,t1_ioy0rew,False,3,09-18-2022,-0.6633,-6.0

They did not want to learn anything new, or change how things were done. They were COBOL programmers, who had been doing the same thing for the same company for 20-30 years. Despite how people think you have a job for life if you have that skill, the company wanted to decommission their application and was trying to get them to re-skill and learn Java. It wasn’t easy for them, because COBOL isn’t like modern languages at all. OOP just didn’t click. They complained about polymorphism being “too complicated”, and how things like classes get in the way, and you should just “write the code and get to the point”. They ultimately gave up, and planned to retire when the decommissioning was complete. People aren’t making new mainframe COBOL applications anymore. There aren’t many jobs to pick from if that is your only skill. The point is, things change little by little but it adds up, until the development landscape is made of all new paradigms and it’s like starting over. It’s easier to keep up than to catch up. 

Maybe you can hang on at the same place until retirement like these guys did, and not learn new skills. Personally, I wouldn’t want to feel trapped at my job.

Many recruiters and software developers tend to think that they need to be constantly working with the ""latest and greatest"", but there are some problems with this approach, problems that don't become apparent until later in your career.

Think about this for moment: if you're constantly learning new technology and forgetting about older technology, what's the incentive for employers hiring a 40+ year old developer over someone who just has two years under their belt and knowing that same stack? Sure, you might have more experience, but employers don't look at it that way. Employers are more than willing to take someone less experienced to reduce costs.

This really boils down to supply and demand. The less supply you have for a specific technology, the more likely you are to have longevity in the field, you create more value. This is a balancing approach and is a bit of an art in itself. There are plenty of companies using either Azure or AWS, but also have legacy code.

No.

You probably should, though. It does help. A lot. And if you are any good at coding, you probably will learn continuously, regardless of whether you make a conscious effort to do so.

But it depends on how you want your career to go.

I've witnessed people in large legacy companies (think, 20k employee Fortune 500 type firms) and large universities stay at roughly the same role for many years. And be totally fine with that.

But for most SWEs and related job roles, one ends up learning new stuff all the time, because software development and computing technologies change all the time.

Honestly, it can get tiring. There are perfectly suitable technologies from the 90s and 2000s which have fallen by the wayside for no other reason than because they aren't new and shiny anymore.

But I get it. It is what it is. If you find you enjoy coding, you also will probably enjoy the learning part. It isn't like learning at school is.",poolpog,,False,t3_wo7dvy,t3_wo7dvy,False,1,08-15-2022,0.9515,17.0

Companies need to advance over time to stay competitive and those changes will expose you to new tools and techniques. 

Unless you want to work in government or academia, where you can get away with not learning anything new for two decades and nobody will fire you but your pay will be 40%-70% market value.  Then the time comes where you decide you want to leave for something new but don’t have any applicable modern skills so you decide to wait for your boss to retire so you can shoot for a management position and continue to do the same until your pension kicks in.  You’ll get bored during this time and feel unfulfilled, so you’ll get really into smoking meats for about a year until you realize that you’ve gained 60 lbs during the short life of the hobby; must be all the brisket. You’ll take a break from smoking meats and buy a high-end bicycle along with all of the tight-fitting gear. This will be your entire personality for about 3 months but during that time you will only use the bike 7 times before deciding that cycling really isn’t all it was cracked up to be after the winter snow and rain picks up and you begin to realize that the local infrastructure isn’t accommodating to cyclists. Your relationship with your wife is fine on the surface, but you can tell that she doesn’t really respect you anymore. Even worse, you left the smoker uncovered all winter and it completely rusted out. Finally your boss retires and you get that management job and it’s perfectly okay.

Maybe create some committees by delegating your responsibilities to the employees under you and appointing them as committee-heads. Hell, you can even force all of your team leads to take an agile course so that half of them begin to loosely use kanban boards when they feel like it (you can call this agile when interviewing prospective new-hires and talking to other managers).

I find cybersecurity to be extremely boring and in most cases it should be. People seem to think it's Hollywood and going into you get to be James bond and make a ton of money, but the reality is its super boring and even the pentesters etc. often just end up running boring tests all day with maybe one exploit rarely here and there. 

The ""more exciting"" stuff is going to require you to likely develop your own tools and methods to break into things and exploit different things that typically can't be talked about due to the obvious nature, but those are much mote rare and for entities I can't talk about. That's offensive. Defensively is typically even more boring as you're doing your standard patching and maybe running some tests on your own walls, but honestly I assure you it is boring work for 90%+ of people.

Yes you will be the guy just saying ""hey guys make sure you comply to this here."" The ""more exciting"" stuff requires coding skills, because you're going to have to develop it yourself in all likelihood. The market is so flooded with everyone wanting to do Cybersecurity typically due to lame articles written by people never in the industry and have no idea what it actually entails selling folks false narratives. 

Industry needs more  experienced (as in closer to 8-10+ years experience already) security professionals, but not so much Jr. roles and tbh it isn't a entry level field in general. You don't want beginners typically in charge of your security. The other thing is, you need to actually know other parts of operations to even be able to do well in the field anyway. People want to just hop into security and don't even understand how networking works for example. 

Learn other areas outside of it. You probably won't get a entry level security role starting out. Extremely rare. What typically happens is you work in a different field and transition over to it. All roles involve security in IT anyhow to some degree. Sysadmin, networking, etc. all can help transition. In this flooded market please research all thr options is all.

30,cscareerquestions,Taking the FE Exam as a software developer,iwm67it,"The first question that I'd ask is if you are in an accredited engineering program. ABET accredits programs in various categories - engineering, computing, science, etc. Just because you're taking an engineering statistics course doesn't mean you're going to be qualified to sit for the exams if your program isn't accredited as an engineering program. You would have to consult your state's licensing board guidelines, since there may be alternative rules for who can sit for the FE exam.

Even if you're qualified based on your state's rules, the closest [FE exam is ""electrical and computing""](https://ncees.org/wp-content/uploads/FE-Electrical-and-Computer-CBT-specs.pdf). Are you going to gain the requisite knowledge to pass that exam through your coursework? There's quite a bit there that, in my experience, isn't covered in a computer science or software engineering degree program. It's far more oriented toward electrical engineering and computer engineering programs.

Once you pass the FE exam, the next step is gaining and documenting experience in preparation for the [PE exam](https://ncees.org/engineering/pe/). This process takes several years and, last time I looked, required a current PE to oversee your work. There aren't a whole lot of Professional Engineers in the software world, but I have worked with some who were PEs in other engineering disciplines. Ensuring staying current on the knowledge areas on the exam (which aren't widely used in software engineering jobs) and documenting the work history can get expensive.

Overall, I don't think this road is useful for software engineers. As much as I'd like to see some kind of licensure to ensure that companies have people that can oversee and sign-off on software engineering work, it's not something that's well supported in the current educational and testing schemes as well as by state licensing bodies. I wouldn't recommend the FE exam to someone in software engineering right now.",TomOwens,Software Engineer,False,t3_ywzc4h,t3_ywzc4h,False,3,11-16-2022,0.92,14.0

32,cscareerquestions,How many of you transitioned to an entry level software engineering/web developer position at age 27 or above?,i7wgkt1,"I ended up in IT (helpdesk) at age of 33, pretty much accidentally - I ran out of career options, had some debt and the only important thing at that time was to have a steady income. At this point, to me, programming was somethings done only by nerds doing it since the age of 6 and I did not have a slightest idea or intention to learn it. 

At first my only goal was to be as good as possible at what I did, which resulted in being transferred to a tech support department, which had a lot of advantages over helpdesk - I was not on call anymore and the job itself was much more technical. Here's where I caught a spark - at around 34ish I started learning SQL. About a year layer started learning Python. Two years later I landed my first ""real"" IT job as a data engineer.

Things from my ""past life"" that helped me a lot:

* soft skills -  I handle people fairly well and apparently I have a good sense of humor - and you wouldn't believe how helpful this is

* writing skills - I write blogs for my company's website and also attract attention on LinkedIn by posting somewhat interesting things 

* book-reading skills - I read a lot of books in my past life but did not realize it's an actual skill - since I learn the best by reading combined with hands-on this helped me pick up a lot of advanced concepts quickly 

* philosophy degree - though not a STEM one, after a while I realized how many transferable skills it has taught me - the most obvious would be logic, of course, and also dealing with abstract concepts (i. e. classes and objects are something philosophy studied long before CS) - as a programmer you work with multiple levels of abstraction and to me that came naturally.",Recent-Fun9535,,False,t3_uldrxx,t3_uldrxx,False,3,05-09-2022,0.953,21.0

\-they won't. 

data science is clearly valuable experience to a software engineer/web developer. Have you not gained experience in algorithms, data structures, programming etc? Math and stats are also valuable, its the same ""language"", the same way of thinking, so this is highly valuable experience to have.

Also, completely disregarding the fact that you actually have worthwhile experience, people that invest time and money into a career change later in life, after having been employed, are among the sexiest employees out there. It shows commitment, you are doing this because you are passionate about it, its demonstrably not just about a pay check to you. Thats the angle I used  when I applied for jobs after I switched from an engineering background into CS, and I got interviews left and right, seemed like a couple had already filled the position,  they just wanted to talk and see who I was, what made me do what I did. I got a job easily, and the the employer I ended up with was thrilled I accepted their offer. 

Most of the young grads have no idea what they want to do with their life. They might do what you did, work for a while, then transition into some other career.  They have tons of misconceptions about working life and careers. Stuff doesnt just happen straight away at work either. Theres bumps in the road, stuff that doesnt pan out the way you where hoping, projects that take longer than you where told. Positions and promotions you want which you have to wait a bit longer for. You demonstrate that you understand that, many young grads struggle to comprehend that, for them that overdue project they dont want to work on, or that promotion that didnt happen, can become a massive crisis, and require tons of management. Whereas you are probably able to find better compromises, work stuff out on your own. 

You also have tons of experience from simply being employed, and having lived for a while, which again is a massive plus. Many new grads have to learn to ask for help. They will spend an endless amount of time trying to figure out the solution to the wrong problem because they are too afraid to ask for help and clarification.

You just need to focus on doing well on this conversion course, and then employers are going to be throwing themselves at you, trust me, it happened to me.",,,False,t3_uldrxx,t3_uldrxx,False,3,05-09-2022,0.9817,15.0

It really is dependent on company. Some companies will be pretty sly about hiring entry level positions strictly for new grads and they tend to have more “traditional” hiring values. Others (and I’ve started to see a lot more of this) are pretty open about your background. I’ve seen someone who had a military pension (20 years in the military) and switched over to CS as a 40ish year old alongside the rest of us 21-22 year olds. There were also others (~7 out of 50 I could see being older) that were older and in different stages of our lives. 

Nowadays, hiring has relaxed a fair bit where you don’t need a degree to break into the field or a traditional background. You just need an employer who is willing to take a risk on you. I even recall someone on this sub got hired with a criminal record as well.

I then went to uni for CS and didn't do well outside of my freshmen year.

I stupidly kept trying to go at the time instead of taking a break and got on AP then flunked out. But,  I always brushed up on my skills and learned some of the concepts I needed to know.

Fast forward 6 years later to 27: I'm back in school with a wife and kiddo (2 y.o.) and another on the way soon.

I think you're fine by putting reasonable salary range into the online application versus leaving it blank. I don't know UK but in US normal cost of living, $70-80k is totally fine.

Easiest way to get hired is by major consulting company. They will definitely not discriminate based on age if you throw them fair starting pay - at least from what I say in my years of experience in consulting. Totally okay and no uncommon to career switch into that industry.

Many companies had hiring freezes or even layoffs once everyone was told to shelter in place. It all worked out in the end though and now I am working for a large enterprise corporation (non-FAANG) full-time as a software engineer. 

Ageism is a thing but if you’re in your late 20s or early 30s I don’t think people care at all. It’s never too late to reinvent yourself, and luckily for this profession results are what matter. So if you’re able to provide valuable skills and experience to a team, and they like you, I don’t think your age would play as much of a factor as you think. 27+ is not old.",47-R0NIN,Software Engineer,False,t3_uldrxx,t3_uldrxx,False,1,05-09-2022,0.7882,5.0

I worked 7 different jobs over a 6 year period after I graduated from college with a degree unrelated to CS or dev. Most were in the hospitality industry (busser, server, catering) and many overlapped so that I could pay the bills. 

My first dev job was at a tiny pre-seed startup where my salary was already more than I’d ever made in my life. I just recently jumped to a massive software company after a year and a half at the startup and almost doubled what I was making. 

I definitely got lucky with the startup I landed at but needless to say I honestly think anywhere I ended up I’d be very happy. 

It’s worth noting I jumped into this industry because I was genuinely interested in software dev before I even had an idea about potential salaries. 

What you make of it and how interested you’ll be plays a huge part in how happy and life changing making a switch like this might be. In my opinion at least.

I had been a self-taught programmer since I was a kid. I started with Qbasic just teaching myself to modify gorillas.bas. I learned html in middle school in 1997. I eventually learned a bunch of c# from Unity tutorials, but I knew that if I wanted to actually code professionally I needed to go back to school.

So I enrolled at a local community college, got an associates in software development, am now gainfully employed in the enterprise sector and am gradually working on completing my bachelors online.

Honestly, I am glad I avoided doing a boot camp - that's +20k  + forgoing earning an income and other living expenses that are better saved.

I studied alone with very minimal mentorship for 3-4 years. During year 4, I started job hunting, but COVID had just started, so it took about 8 months to find a job. During that time, I just kept applying and polishing my skills and portfolio.

As far as what materials I used to learn, I did many Udemy courses, some Youtube tutorials, and I did most of the Odin Project. Those and Googling are really all you need.

Before I was a dev, and during my training, I was a senior data analyst. I worked for 2 years at a digital marketing agency, then 2 at a consumer goods manufacturer.

The data analyst experience helped me land a data engineer role in a software engineering department at a small company. Data Engineering is one of those roles that may or may not be a developer-type role. I did my research and hedged my bets here. Luckily for me, this was in fact a software engineering role with heavy programming responsibilities.

I worked alongside the other software engineers on my team, then took my current job after a year there for more money, remote flexibility, and as an official full-stack software engineer title. I worked in C#, and now I work in JS (TypeScript, ES6+, GraphQL, NodeJS).

I actually found it helpful to build things that were similar, but not actually the same as the tutorial I was watching.

For example, I wanted to build a movie app that was sort of a clone of IMDB, but the tutorial I used was for a recipe app.

I feel like that helped me understand the concepts a little bit better because I was forced to adapt the same principles to a different context (also using a different api). The instructor would make a quick search feature that used ingredients, so I did the same idea only with movie genres. That ended up being a completely different process, so I had to figure it out on my own, then come back to the tutorial to move on to the next part.

When I was at work, I proposed some projects that would help improve the company intranet. I also let the CTO know that I was willing to pick up dev tickets if they needed help (we're a small company - contacting the CTO directly isn't a big deal).

I also told the Android dev that I was learning Android Development and if there were any small bug tickets or anything that he needed help with, I'd be willing to help out. Ultimately, the Android dev mentioned it to his boss who mentioned it to the CTO.

Your question of getting a target on your back makes me think there is an issue with heavy-handed management, but your quip about agile… when done badly that could also be a problem with heavy-handed management, but leaving because of agile could also mean you may have had a toxic IT department.

This varies greatly depending on what's being protected.

We're also in the wild west times of security. It exists as a thing, but there's no demands placed externally to implement it.

44,cscareerquestions,Salesforce Developer at Unicorn vs SWE at Midwestern Software Company,io82amv,"I did Netsuite, which is a niche that kinda competes with Salesforce, for two years and it was VERY hard to get away from it. Ended up eventually getting a job in the Midwest like what OP described. Did that job for a year and a half and then got a fully remote job out of California for a 75% salary increase (no crazy leetcode grind either).

OP, I strongly recommend taking the job in the Midwest. Yes it pays less but COL will be less which will negate some of that. Also, these systems are very proprietary on purpose, it locks in not only people and their careers but entire companies. ERP/CRM migrations and implementations are very hard jobs and can cost a company into the millions. 
Maybe the unicorn and San Francisco will look good at first glance but when you have the interview it'll be pretty obvious you were in Salesforce, not their actual product. And, speaking from experience, personal projects mean nothing when your main job is so different. Angular dev learning vue and getting a vue job? Sure. Salesforce dev learning vue? Sorry, you're not even a front end dev.

Salesforce is a whole different niche of software development called ERP/CRM software and these systems are all very proprietary. You won't be some kind of backend or frontend dev. You'll be a Salesforce dev. Your tech stack is literally just Salesforce's APIs and tooling.

Salesforce devs don't even have the same recruiters/headhunter companies as other devs. Applies to all CRM/ERP systems. For Netsuite, the big one is Anderson Frank. 

Based on my personal experience, and what I read on this sub, there's really no reason for competent devs to get into these niche systems. It's kinda like how some people (people not in tech) will tell you that you should learn cobol and you'll get a really secure, specialized 90k/yr job!

As someone who works in a company that makes top dollar job offers, sorry but no it's not a matter of compensation. Hire rate for candidates that manage to get past HR screening to interview w/ me (applying for senior/staff level) is around 10% (and my sample size is in the hundreds of candidates). And it's not just me, it's not uncommon for my company at all to go through 10+ candidates for any given position, and it hasn't been uncommon for previous companies I've worked at either.

I see candidates that mess up basic stuff like class or function syntax. I see candidates that spew pre-memorized stuff when it isn't even relevant. I see candidates that drop tons of buzzwords but completely flail as soon as you ask a probing question. We get a bunch of people coming in eyeing our 300k-500k TC jobs and most simply don't meet the bar.

From what I've seen, companies w/ less competitve comp have comparatively easier interviews. But same story, the candidates applying for a 200k job are those currently making 150k, and many of those don't meet the bar that justifies the 200k comp. And so on all the way down the comp ladder.

OP is complaining about the absolute bottom tier garbage candidates and, yeah, everyone that has interviewed a significant enough number of candidates will have stories about really bad candidates.

COBOL is a tough area from a career development perspective, if you want learn more about COBOL then you could try to make a niche out of it but your mobility to other jobs might be limited.  If you want to keep you options open I would focus more on the java side of things.

When you are done your work early just make sure that you are really ""done"".  I find that entry level devs ""finish"" the work to make it ""work"" but don't necessarily make it robust, readable, and flexible.  And often times many edge cases in the code can be found where their code does not work.  I would recommend you ask for peer reviews on your code if you finish early and learn what you can from senior devs.",burnt_out_dev,Software Architect,False,t3_x1yunj,t3_x1yunj,False,12,08-31-2022,0.8668,7.0

It's very junior-esque to be assigned tasks and just complete them. You're being told what to do and are being given simple easily scoped tasks to complete. Basically you're doing your job and doing it as expected.

A part of advancing your career is ownership and prioritization. If you bucket tasks as ""my tasks"" and ""not my tasks"" then you're going to stay a junior forever. Ownership is knowing what's on the backlog and knowing why it's there. Prioritization is knowing which tasks are the highest impact and/or blocking other tasks and getting those done first. You can't do ownership and prioritization if your mindset is, ""These are my tasks, I'm done, now my job is done.""

I'm not advocating for overworking. 100% you should sign off at the end of the day. But signing off comes at the end of the day. If you're done with your assigned work, then think about the backlog and grab the highest priority task off it.",lIllIlIIIlIIIIlIlIll,,False,t3_x1yunj,t3_x1yunj,False,6,08-31-2022,-0.0258,-1.0

In my first company, I more than doubled comp through a promo and a team change.

My second job didn't have a lot of growth potential but it had very interesting work with lots of ownership/autonomy. The second job hop happened after only a few years and was a move to big tech for a 100% increase in TC. I'm still at this third company. My TC has increased substantially since I joined (~100% increase through a combination of promo and bonuses) and I still feel I can grow more, although it'll be challenging.

I make close to $400k, with good WLB. Work can be busy, but it is rarely if ever stressful, and quite satisfying overall. I am also still growing in the role, and I think it's fairly realistic to grow up to maybe $500k or $600k if I continue to put in the work.

I don't see a world where a headhunter would have an offer that would ever entice me out of my current job. Since I'm happy, I wouldn't leave for an equal or lesser amount. I also wouldn't leave for a marginally greater amount. But when it comes to far greater amounts like $700k+, I also wouldn't leave because I'd be doubtful it'd be a good deal for me. Sometimes I get emails from recruiters dangling amounts like that, and they kind of sus me out. I feel like it's not worth the risk

1. they might work you for every drop of that $700k
2. they might be trying to recruit someone who can swoop in and be a superhero. bringing me to point (1) where they work me for ungodly hours
3. that $700k likely comes with strings attached. I imagine it's certainly not all cash, maybe deferred compensation or some kind of bonus they could very well fail to pay out in practice

And at the end of the day I'm not ambitious enough to want to jump around and fast-track my way to big time CTO or something. I don't think I have that in me. I am ambitious enough to still want to grow in my current role, sure, and maybe I was ambitious enough to have ended up in my current role - but with close to $400k and a good WLB at this point, I can't be bothered to consciously aim for higher, outside of having it happen naturally.",cringecaptainq,Software Developer,False,t3_wwcu16,t1_ill87v9,1661393642.0,1,08-25-2022,0.9891,26.0

 I have 3 questions if you don't mind. I'm interested in learning in demand tech like Scala Spark K8s Kafka etc. 

1. How did you go about learning these proficiently?

2. What was your mindset like during your initial SWE years when you would commit 10 hours/wk to learning?

3. Did you find balance with other aspects of your life (fitness, hobbies, social, reading, maybe a side gig?) while committing yourself to this?

If that isn't an option, I would use online resources to get basic proficiency and then start building some personal projects using them.  The goal though is to get just get good enough on your own to get a full time position so you can learn how a company works with them in production.

My mindset for the learning was to identify the biggest areas I was weak in, and then create a structured learning plan for filling in those gaps.  List them out, do some research on what the best learning resources are (I spent a lot of time reading reddit and other forum posts where people recommended books or online courses).  Then keep track of your progress, being able to check off goals you have accomplished is a huge motivator.  Also identify when the best time for you to study is so that you have maximum retention.  For me that was first thing in the morning, so I would wake up early to take advantage.

Finally to your last point, the first couple years I was grinding I didn't take as good of care of myself as I should have.  10 hours + work still leaves plenty of time to hit the gym, socialize on weekends etc...  IMO it is critical to spend time outside of work and study with your hobbies and unwinding, otherwise you will hit a very common thing in the industry known as burnout.  Whenever I feel myself start to hit this I always back way off, maybe even taking a whole week off personal study.

What the fuck? Why would you not consider 401k accounts to be part of savings and assets? It’s not “gone” it’s literally saving money. At Google you can put $20k in and it’s matched 100%, so not only is that $20k not “gone”, but it gets doubled. 


Yeah I’m gonna call bullshit on this. 250k is mid level at FAANG with an average YoE of 5 years or less. I’d bet dollars to donuts the vast majority of mid level 250k FAANG engineers do *not* have wives and kids. 

Not only that, but if they *do* have a wife, then the 250k isn’t necessarily their only salary.

Not only that, but the “cars are expensive, so are weddings and children” applies throughout the whole US.

So, sure. If you manage to spend $5,000 a month **after rent is paid for** then you are only saving $40k a year from the 401k plan. Which is still more than the median US income alone.

Your comment is honestly nonsense do you actually believe what you’re saying? To make the point that a 250k salary in SF is a wash, you (a) assumed the person was married and had an expensive wedding, (b) assumed their spouse doesn’t work, (c) assumed they had kids, (d) assumed they buy expensive cars, (e) still ended up with them saving the after-tax equivalent of a $65k or $70k salary. That’s approximately what $40k after taxes is — 65 or so before.",cristiano-potato,,False,t3_wwcu16,t1_illt8mw,False,11,08-24-2022,-0.5424,-8.0

There are often options, not just a single ""choice.""

While rent in SF is absurd, many people have the opportunity to rent outside the city for a substantially lower cost (and then factor in potential remote work from a FAANG [I have a friend who is fully remote], then commute/rent costs can differ dramatically).

By insurance, I believe you mean car insurance. Well not every person will choose to purchase the latest and greatest (thereby reducing insurance costs). Furthermore, those that are more financially responsible will not choose something that must be financed for them to ""afford"" (unless it is an absolute necessity or emergency).

A marriage for hundreds of thousands(!), whew buddy I want to be invited to yours! I've had friends and acquaintances, some of whom are techies in various cities (others are engineers, healthcare workers, etc), pull it off for substantially less. And who is to say that OP even wants to get married and have children (literally all of my closest friends have stated that they don't want kids haha, so it is a very real possibility OP is in a similar boat/mindset at this point in time).

All in all, my point is you state your case as if everyone with some money in a big name city chooses to spend as if their salary is a goal to be hit. While you may know people that choose to live like that, that may not be OP's MO. Many people forget that a good goal is to be rich, not to look rich.

Plus, that doesn't factor in the beauty of the locale/California. You can start your day off in or near the city, then drive to the ocean coast and up and down a number of mountain ranges all within several hours drive. Further out, you have national parks and other major cities. So there's a sort of counterbalance to all the city living that many VLCOL places don't necessarily have.

To each their own, but, IMHO, it isn't much of a wash unless OP decides to go to a local laundromat in SF.",feed_meknowledge,,False,t3_wwcu16,t1_illt8mw,False,6,08-24-2022,0.9937,25.0

So ideally you want that last internship to be as close as possible to the job you want.

56,cscareerquestions,Current SDET -> Software Developer Job Offer Dilemma,iqkxoep,"I broke into tech from a non-tech job by taking a web application dev job with a university. These were the pros and cons of that environment in my experience:

Pros
——-

* Experience for future SWE jobs obviously 

* Great benefits with lots of PTO/sick leave/cheap insurance/other decent perks

* Relatively low-demand work at a mega slow pace, never overtime or off-hours work (unless you have on-call responsibilities)  

* Near-absolute job security — we required three days in the office too but I know most people were blowing them off on a regular basis with zero repercussions

* Probably plenty of time for professional development and personal projects due to the slow pace (this can also be a con as professional development on actual work is more valuable) 

* Varied work — we supported dozens of websites with a few different stacks. There were ETL and automation projects to do. Lots of room for improvement which made it easy to excel. And rarely in a rush for anything, haha. 

Cons
____
* Low pay, you’ll never get a decent/any raise either 
* Won’t be a tech shop, meaning non-IT management will hinder a lot of perks dev take for granted (3 days a week in the office, for example — I bet this is because non-tech staff have this requirement too)
* Decent chance of older tech stacks like legacy ASP.NET and/or static web pages managed with a CMS like WordPress or Drupal
* I’d be surprised if there were automated tests or deployments, so much was done manually (this also represents an opportunity for you, though)
* Toxic managers and inept colleagues are impossible to get rid of in public service, and they stick around for the easy job security. 


You’re in a different situation than I was — not being in tech yet, it was still a decent raise for me despite the relatively low pay for the field, so it was an easy accept for me. As a financially lateral move it might be harder to stomach for you — but I will say that after a couple years at this job I started getting interest from real companies and got recruited to a tech startup as a SWE.

There are a lot of other things that are important; I play matchmaker between junior and senior engineers for mentorship opportunities, help senior engineers find and promote visible features and subprojects that they can own for their own career advancement and do a lot of liaising with other teams that we depend on, and that depend on us.

- start the day w/ 3-4 hours of deep work focused on coding or writing docs
- the remaining hours are more ""distracted"" work such as meetings, small bug fixes, emails

when do you feel most rewarded in your job?
- When I see tangible value from a project I delivered

what are the toughest problems that you encounter with your job?
- There's so much to learn daily. It seems everyday there's a new problem that you have little context on from prev work exp or education

how quick did you find your job out of college?
- Got a job before graduating


what piece of advice would you give someone who wants to pursue your career?
- talk to SWEs and see what they do. You can also research this online. If you like it, work hard & join us. There can be gate keeping in this career field but IMO anyone can be a SWE with hard work

if you were to hire someone today for an entry-level position in this career field, what would be some factors influencing your choice of one candidate over the other?
- Grit & problem solving skills & soft skills. Does the person welcome a problem w/ a ""I can find a solution"" attitude or no?

Took ~9 months to study and apply while working part time jobs and draining my minimal savings. Eventually I got lucky with a company where I learned a lot more.

I'd just get the CS degree. Focus on the important classes like DSnA, networking, OS, discrete math, etc while aiming for Cs or Bs in everything else. I have about 3 years of experience as a back end software engineer now and it's still tough to compete with some CS grads. The head start I have on experience doesn't make up for the lack of foundation. Plus, a good CS knowledge is just required for many of the best roles. Companies say it's not required. Technically, it's not required, but in practical terms it is because the best jobs attract pretty talented CS grads. So you'll need to be exceptional to overcome that credential deficit.

71,cscareerquestions,People who made a career switch to software development from a different profession. What was your path & experience?,itqaa6t,"1. I had a weird path, I took a break from college during my final semester to work on a start-up for two years (it was a successful algo trading firm that was a glorified web scraper, turned it off earlier this year). I was also the Finance Strategy Manager (right-hand person for the CFO whom I interned with in college). I had a couple investment banking offers in NYC and a strategy analyst offer for a F150. However, from my experience with the algo trading firm, I knew that programming was more enjoyable.
2. I was able to transition because I went back to school and picked up/finished a comp-sci minor in the summer and fall semesters of 2021. Those projects in addition to my algo trading firm experience gave me some callbacks for applications I sent in. I did not learn anything on the side.
3. School plus my algo trading firm
4. I was working at the Finance Strategy manager doing automation work (basically automating accounting functions / jobs) and I had the offers from the investment bank / F150 at the time, but I knew that I could not stand the absolute idiots working in Finance anymore. I started applying to software engineering jobs at the same time (so 1-2 months to get a full-stack software engineer position from when I started to apply).
5. Yes I went from a Finance Manager position (which was good for my age 25) to an entry level software engineer role.
6. Fully employed -- python CLI, Python library, JS react website, rails backend
7. Not really, they were just looking for smart people. They specifically mentioned that they dont care if you know how to code, they just care if the candidate is intelligent and a fast learner. Everyone at my new place has PhD's from schools like Columbia and UIUC.
8. Definitely hit me financially because I was getting paid a LOT more in my finance manager position . My salary is average / above-average for a full stack role entry-level role.
9. Yeah I honestly wish I had built my own website with a Postgres database, rails backend, and vue/react front end. That would have given me so much experience with everything web especially with API's and databases",Sweet-Dust-7444,,False,t3_yd03xk,t3_yd03xk,1666710475.0,3,10-25-2022,0.9842,18.0
71,cscareerquestions,People who made a career switch to software development from a different profession. What was your path & experience?,itqdimj,"1. What did you do before and what do you do now? (Or did you maybe go back after trying out programming?)

I was a Middle School Religion Teacher prior to making the switch.
    
2. How did you transition? Did you quit your job to dedicate fully to learning or do it on the side?

It took me 9 months. That is from leaving my old job, starting to self-learn, switching my end goal, and finding a job. I left my old job and my family moved in with my in-laws.
    
3. Which route did you choose for learning? (School/Bootcamp/Self taught/other?) and why?

Self-taught. I couldn't afford either a Bootcamp or School.
    
4. How long did the transition roughly take in total? (From decision to first job)

The decision occurred about 2-3 months prior to getting the ball rolling. So, a year in total.
    
5. Did you go from a more senior role in your old career track to a more junior role? How did you feel about it/deal with it?

I had been teaching for 3 years out of college, so I'm not sure it would necessarily translate.
    
6. What kind of work did you start with after the switch? (Fully employed, free lance/contractor, self-employed with own projects)

I was initially given an internship that I worked for literally two weeks (1 hour commute, $20 hr doing IT Help Desk stuff) that I was barely breaking even on. I left it when I received an offer for a full-time Web Designer gig that paid a bit more, had full-time benefits and would put me on the path that I wanted to be on.
    
7. Did you encounter any difficulties/scepticism in the recruiting process as a result of your switch?

In the recruiting process, yes and no. For the first gig it was **very** hard to get a phone screen because I had 0 experience. Once I actually got to the interviews, the people I spoke with seemed impressed with what I knew, what I was able to do on my Github profile, and that I did it all on my own (with the necessary support of family along the way)..
    
8. How did the decision affect you financially? (Short term/long term)

I hope I never forget this, but I think it was during a meeting prior to the start of my second year of teaching when the admin showed us a graphic that detailed the career progression and compensation that I would get if I remained employed at the school. I want to say it maxed out at like 42k or 45k and that was after many years of teaching and I think with a Master's too. Well, my first job was at the type of place that would hire anyone and they paid a price that reflected that disposition. It was 43k. It was also in a HCOL area, so it was especially low. But, they gave me a chance that literally no one else was willing to offer. My salary now, nearly 5 years later has tripled. I'm not at a FAANG, but the place I'm at now has given me opportunities as a developer that I never could have imagined.
    
9. Is there one specific thing you'd change or would have liked to know beforehand?

No. I tend to be naive. When I first had the thought of switching from teaching to tech, it came after 14+ months of trying to find a better-paying job where I lived. I sent out dozens, if not hundreds of applications and never received so much as a phone call back. I was literally unemployable outside of teaching. So when I settled on the tech idea, I had a mentality that would be best described as, ""How hard can it be?"" If I had any awareness of how difficult my journey would have been, I doubt I would have had the tenacity to make the same decision. Sometimes ignorance is bliss.",TheoTeach,Software Developer,False,t3_yd03xk,t3_yd03xk,False,3,10-25-2022,0.9487,18.0
71,cscareerquestions,People who made a career switch to software development from a different profession. What was your path & experience?,itprnar,"1. I worked in technical support for about a decade before managing to make the switch to SWE.  Personally, I would never go back.  A lot of people on various programming subreddits will complain about certain aspects of software engineering; while those complaints may be warrented, my life is objectively much better since I made the switch.  I make more money, I’m far less stressed, and the work is much more engaging.  It’s a win-win.

2. I spent a lot of time wanting to quit and work on learning full time, but I never actually did.  I kept working full time while I would do as much studying as I could in the evenings.  Unfortunately, due to fluctuating stress levels and demands of my full time job, I wasn’t always consistent in how much I would do.  Some weeks, I would study several hours each night; others, I might only study once or twice.  I put it on the back burner a few times.  It took a lot longer than it probably would have taken someone working a less mentally draining job.  That said, I don’t exactly regret my choices for reasons I’ll get into shortly.

3. I started off self-teaching, but I ultimately ended up using a bootcamp that allowed me to do a part time schedule.  I switched jobs within my old career near the start of COVID which lead to somewhat reduced stress and stabilized work demands and decided that I wanted to accelerate my learning.  Bootcamps, in general, can help either get someone with a good career history either job ready or close enough to job ready that it only takes a few more months to get there and I was able to find one that had recently started up so the cost was relatively cheap.

4. Approximately 3 years, but I definitely took my time compared to some people.

5. Yeah, by the time I made the switch from support to engineering, I was our top performing escalations agent with the most tenure and was functionally acting as a team lead.  I didn’t mind the switch, though.  Everyone on my current team is super supportive and helpful.  In a way, it’s kind of relaxing not being the person everyone goes to when things go south.

6. Fully employed!  

7. No.  In fact, I was really, really lucky.  About two weeks after I graduated from my bootcamp, one of the internal recruiters at the company I worked for then and still work for now reached out (which is a tech unicorn), told me she’d seen my post on LinkedIn, and wanted to know if I had any interest in applying for an Associate Engineer position internally.  I told her yes, applied for the job, and after a few rounds of interviews, I got the job.  That said, this is definitely an extreme edge case: I had built-up a lot of positive reputation at the company already and we have a history of hiring career-switchers (some of our current architects and staff software engineers started at the company several years ago in other departments) into engineering.  I know this process is much harder for most career switchers.

8. Short-term, I paid roughly $3000 for the bootcamp I attended plus some other learning resources along the way.  Long term, when I accepted my first engineering role, I got a substantial raise (~$20,000) and nearly doubled what my salary had been only a couple years prior.  So obviously a very positive return.

9. Honestly, there’s not much I would change?  Biggest trap I personally fell into was spending several months in tutorial hell.  If you self-teach, please use something like The Odin Project that’s always challenging you to build projects because it’s very easy to start buying Udemy courses where you watch a lot of videos and do a lot of code-alongs, but never solve any problems with code on your own.",lumenilis,,False,t3_yd03xk,t3_yd03xk,False,2,10-25-2022,0.9966,27.0

2.	I ended up quitting my job unexpectedly due to my boss being a psycho. I had planned on learning on the side but this allowed me to freelance and learn. I imagine it helped having more time to dedicate to it, but it was definitely more stressful. 

3.	Initially self taught but I was having difficulty learning JavaScript on my own so I took a class. The structure definitely helped and now I (mostly) love JavaScript.

4.	I only seriously decided to switch careers about 6 months before I did. To be fair, I had some web development experience at that point, but very basic stuff.

Over time you get a feel for the type of language the companies you would like to work at use. For example, in my area I don't trust the word ""programmer"". I'm not saying I won't LOOK at a job for a ""Programmer"" or ""Software Programmer"". But in my experience, companies using that term don't offer the type of environment or growth I want. ""Full Stack Developer"" is iffy as well. The concept isn't bad. I WANT to hire full stack developers as we can support each other. But when hiring it should be to fulfill a specific need. A company hiring a ""full stack developer"" often doesn't know what it wants, or lacks proper specialization.

In contrast, terms like ""Software Engineer IV"" and ""Staff Engineer"" I consider good signs. It implies the company has an actual technical progression track and isn't forcing their senior engineers into management positions. Which has further good implications for their process and culture.

Hey, you seem like a smart guy so I was wondering if you could give me some advice...

Have you ever accidentally blown up at your boss?

I’m a few months into my job and I guess you could say that I haven’t quite gotten the whole ‘working well under pressure’ thing tied down yet.

Yesterday l was taking longer than I should have to complete a task and was beginning to stress hard. I was on the cusp of solving the problem when my boss walks over and asks to take a look at my code and I told him wait it’s almost done. He insisted that he take a look because of how long it is taking and my instinctual reaction was to say ‘fuck off, I’ll show you in a few minutes’.

I immediately realized what I had said and we both just stare at each other for a couple of seconds. I kind of doubled down and said ‘come back in 10 minutes’, but he didn’t and we haven’t spoken today even though he’s in the office. He has merged the pull request I made, so that’s a good sign right? 

Have you ever been in a similar situation, and how did you handle it? Am I just overthinking things?",ToeMouse123,,False,t3_vzyyem,t1_igbcl28,False,27,07-21-2022,0.8301,-2.0

79,cscareerquestions,Is there such a thing as a software developer career coach to get you to the next level in your career?,ih070vm,"Staff eng at Uber here.

If you're at a big company w/ a deep established IC track, the expectations for each level will likely be in your company's performance appraisal/promotion guidelines. If you've already gone through the promo process, the rubrics should be familiar to you. If not, you should start benchmarking your career growth against these specific rubrics when you meet w/ your manager.

You mentioned your next step is staff level. The biggest differentiator between senior and staff is in the scope of collaboration. A senior person is someone who is comfortable leading a team, and talking to stakeholders in service of the team's project. A staff level person is someone who initiates cross-team collaboration in service of a goal for an organization/vertical within the company, typically something that is larger in scope than what a single team can be responsible for. We often call this ""working in a cross-functional capacity"".

Many seniors think they've ""topped out"" in terms of responsibilities/growth because e.g. they're a backend lead talking to a BA about requirements and then going to a frontend lead to talk about what the data fetching API should look like. So, ""cross-team collaboration"", right? Yes, but the scope is limited to a single project.

In contrast, the scope of staff level effort might be about figuring out why moving to GraphQL/GRCP/Kubernetes/Bazel/whatever could fix widespread organizational inefficiencies and what is the cost/benefit analysis from the perspective of every *type* of team that such an effort would impact. It might be an effort to decrease the number of outages within your vertical. It might an effort to implement end-to-end tracing across frameworks (and then rolling everything out to all production services). These are not your average cookie cutter CRUD projects with more-or-less-fleshed-out requirements. And yes, these are real examples I've seen at work.

Proactiveness is IMHO a pretty big part of operating at staff level and above, so the idea of sitting and waiting to be coached is kinda antithetical to the idea of being ambitious enough to get past the senior ""terminal level"".",lhorie,,False,t3_w41qhm,t3_w41qhm,1658374739.0,13,07-21-2022,0.9538,18.0

The coaching I'm describing is about learning the skills, habits/routines and experience (the ingredients) to identify org-wide issues. This is often the thing people expect of you, but never train you to do. Here are some things I've thought about.

\- How often do you spend in and out of work learning your craft? This could be attending conferences, reading articles, playground experimenting with technologies.

\- What activities usually give you your insights. Maybe you spend a lot of time talking to various stakeholders and deeply understand their pain points. If so, what type of questions are you asking, especially those unprompted by others.

\- How do you split your time? Especially doing things that are not directly outside your tasked work. Maybe I'm over-focusing on speed/productivity. Or I should be spending 1 hour a day really learning/understanding other parts of the system.

I get that I need to understand a wider net of stakeholders, or that I gotta show leadership, and yes there are rubrics. But they only tell you what you have to achieve, not how to achieve them. In the analogy of sports, you need to do drills so you can do the movements before you can execute strategies. The foundation (drills and movements) are what I'm lacking.

79,cscareerquestions,Is there such a thing as a software developer career coach to get you to the next level in your career?,ih20f4s,"Personally, I have two main avenues for getting informed about what needs attention:

1) listen to what the higher ups are saying - high level OKRs have reasons. These might be listed in proposals and design documents for large org-wide efforts. A lot can just be inferred from experience and understanding the strengths of the proposed tools/approaches. For example, if a director starts talking about code coverage, the reason is likely related to frequency of incidents. So then the question in your head should be ""well, how *should* we reduce incidents?"" Maybe that's carving a role for yourself in the code coverage effort, maybe it's advocating/delivering something else.

2) listen to what coworkers are saying - common questions and complaints indicate inefficiencies. Some are simply tweaking some configuration, others are deep rabbit holes. The rabbit hole ones are the interesting ones, because they're often too daunting for individual senior levels, and there's often opportunity to generalize problems and solutions to multiply impact.

There are multiple ways to get information: by cultivating support channels, by fostering relationships with engineers outside your normal circle, by participating more in high level design/planning/RFC discussions. To those ends, you need to bring expertise to the table in order to provide value and continue to provide value on an ongoing basis, so that others *want* to work with you.

Time management: if you're senior, you should already have an idea of how to allocate your time. Perhaps more importantly, you should have some authority/autonomy to decide how to allocate your time. E.g. if you're faced w/ ""We don't have time to test"" excuses, you should be able to articulate why that's counterproductive. Similarly, you can choose not to take the ""I'm just going to solve *my* problem by hard coding this for now"" narrow-minded approach that people often take. You can iterate, you can advocate, you can play the office politics, you can shoot first and ask questions later. Every approach is a tool with pros and cons.

Foundation-wise, the rule of thumb is: the more you know, the merrier. There's a saying that luck is when opportunity meets preparedness. So learn tech outside of your comfort zone, read about architectures, understand 2 levels below the abstraction you normally use, talk to people, help people. For me, I worked on an OSS project in my free time that eventually got some traction (~13k github stars as of today). This was a great opportunity for me to put everything I had learned about testing quality, community management, strictness of semantics, breaking change rollouts, etc to the test.

MIT's 6.006 is a great course on algorithms.




Not really. ""Software developer with a medical degree"" is too niche. Even people building medical software don't need a medical degree or anything close. There is a lot of demand for good/experienced software engineers though.


If you don't want to be a software engineer, you can look into roles in IT by posting in /r/ITCareerQuestions

The fundamental differences, as I understand them, between things like web vs embedded are:

* Thinking hard about memory utilization, algorithmic efficiency, resource allocation/deallocation, memory layout, etc.
* In the safety critical world, which is an offshoot of embedded, you have to build code that works *every single time*. There's no ""oh it doesn't work on version X.Y of that browser"" or ""yeah sometimes the server crashes or hangs and we have to restart it"". If our software experiences *anything* that is not nominal then we do a full investigation. That could be something as little as a single packet out of a million was delivered half a millisecond late.
* Often you'd be working with hardware, which can be frustrating since you have to deal with the real world instead of a sandbox browser or container that is fully controlled

The transition path would probably look like:

* Review the things you learned in school like computer architecture, algorithms, operating systems, data structures, etc.
* Start in an embedded job and learn as you go. You'd probably start entry level.",tim36272,,True,t3_waxd6m,t1_iiaidkn,False,2,07-30-2022,0.3182,1.0

100,cscareerquestions,Is there such thing as software developers who only write unit/integration tests?,im9vbku,"SDET sounds like the closest to what you're looking for, but IME, they typically focus more on integration/end-to-end tests than unit tests.

There's no really such a thing as someone who exclusively writes unit tests. If you write them yourself, you should know that it takes some discipline to write unit testable code in the first place, so you'd be basically be asking someone to either write god awful tests due to not touching the code, or to be perpetually refactoring hard-to-test code full time since the rest of the team never gets burned by writing the untestable code. Neither sounds like a great idea, and it's bound to create some team friction, compared to the idea of ramping up test culture among the existing team, e.g. by requiring regression tests in code reviews for bug fixes.

The idea of ""documentor"" similarly suffers from the issue of focusing on mechanics rather than growth. Even a very large project won't require full time documentation work (and I say this as someone who worked on/documented a large project spanning 70+ packages), and a large portion of the value prop of documentation is to transmit expertise. An outsider looking in can only do so much, compared to someone who knows the system well. If you're going to need the ""documentor"" to constantly bug people in order to understand what's going on, you might as well officially slow down development speed - since that's what you'd effectively be doing anyways - and remove the broken telephone aspect from the picture. If you're talking about hiring 2 extra headcount and these are both developers, it shouldn't even realistically affect team throughput negatively to simultaneously ramp up best practices in the team.

Okay, now this is  you misinterpreting his intentions. For nutrecht, it has nothing to do with praise but rather whether they actually looked at what he wrote and whether they were actually helped.

His exact words from that thread:

There is NO way he understood everything that is happening there. But if he's not interesting in actually learning stuff then my effort is just a complete waste of time.""  


As he stated, it takes time to write such a long response. I don't think anyone likes knowing they wasted their time trying to help someone.  

So I mean, I think it makes sense he's not going to invest the time to write such a long reply if he doesn't know if the person is worth investing his time with.

And I gave them instructions about how to test whether wired Ethernet not working is the router or their computer. And eventually they finally said that if the problem is their computer they didn't have enough money for a new computer anyways. And it's like, how about you state that in the first place so people don't waste their time. >_>
